Key features of this game includes a limited inventory system (where players can only carry two weapons at a time, and must swap with weapons on the ground) and <a href=\"/shield-regeneration/3015-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">regenerative shields</a> (which charge over time). The game received <a href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">numerous sequels and spin-offs</a> throughout the years, mainly for the Xbox line of consoles.</p><p>The game also received a port to the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> (in conjunction with <a href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\">Gearbox</a>) on September 30, 2003. This version traded split-screen multiplayer support with <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online multiplayer</a> for up to 16 players. Along with a <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a> release on December 3, 2003, Gearbox released a multiplayer-focused expansion (called <em>Halo Custom Edition</em>) allowing for custom user-created maps, mods, and other content.</p><p>The game later received an enhanced port by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/343-industries/3010-6753/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6753\">343 Industries</a> (in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/saber-interactive/3010-2282/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2282\">Saber</a>) for the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>. Published by <a href=\"/xbox-game-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a> on November 15, 2011 as <em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em>, this port features updated high-definition graphics (which can be toggled on-the-fly using either a dedicated button and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\">Kinect</a> voice recognition), remastered sounds, Xbox Live co-operative multiplayer, bonus features (including using Kinect voice recognition to give in-combat directives and finding collectible <a href=\"/skull/3055-641/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-641\">\"Skulls\"</a> that modify gameplay when active). Although the multiplayer part of Halo is not included, the port includes a restricted version of the multiplayer portion of Bungie's <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\">Halo: Reach</a>, featuring six remakes (created by <a href=\"/certain-affinity/3010-6279/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6279\">Certain Affinity</a>) of classic Halo maps. The campaign portion (alongside the original Multiplayer) was later included n the <a href=\"/halo-the-master-chief-collection/3030-46552/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46552\">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> compilation for the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Halo was a revolutionary first-person shooter in the controls department, inventing the concept of using the two analogue sticks to move and aim, while on the PC the player uses the keyboard and mouse. It differs from most others at the time in the damage system, where it has the standard health bar with eight bars which decrease when hit after the shields have failed (can be replenished with health packs). As opposed to picking up an \"armor power up\" the player always has shields which slowly take damage when hit like a secondary health bar, if hit enough they fail and health begins to decrease, and if the player keeps their head down long enough they recharge. Halo made this style of health regeneration popular within many games made today, and this reason is one of many of why Halo was so revolutionary. Along with popularizing health regeneration Halo also popularized restricting the player to only carrying two weapons at a time, simultaneously solving the problem of cycling through large numbers of weapons on a console pad and forcing developers to make every weapon \"count\", as the pistol could no longer be a near-useless weapon of last resort, for example.</p><p>Power ups include over-shields, health packs, and active camo (invisibility).</p><h3>Weapons</h3><h4>Human Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/m6d-pistol/3055-2806/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2806\"><strong>Pistol</strong></a> - A semi-automatic slow-firing <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">handgun</a> noted for its powerful <a href=\"/magnum/3055-1823/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1823\">magnum</a> ammunition and high accuracy for close-to-medium ranges (with a 2x magnification \"smart scope\" that relays data directly to the user's HUD).

Unlike other arena multiplayer games at the time, no <a href=\"/bots/3015-597/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-597\">bots</a> are supported.</p><p>While the PC and Mac ports of the game removed split-screen multiplayer support, they added support for <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online multiplayer</a> for up to 16 players through GameSpy. Shortly before the demise of GameSpy's service in May 2014, Bungie released an official patch to keep the server list functionality online.</p><h3>Maps</h3><p>The base game included 13 maps of varying sizes, only two of which support vehicles. The PC and Mac ports of the game added six additional maps (all of which support vehicles) created by Gearbox.</p><p>All maps were later included in <a href=\"/halo-the-master-chief-collection/3030-46552/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46552\">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>.</p><h4>Standard Maps</h4><ul><li><strong>Battle Creek</strong> (2-8 players, symmetrical bases) -

Humans, under the United Nations Space Command ( <a href=\"/unsc/3015-3859/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC</a>) have harnessed faster-than-light \"Slipspace\" travel and have colonized hundreds of planets in solar systems across the galaxy. During the Human expansion, they encounter an alliance of alien species, called <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">the Covenant</a>, who are inexplicably intent on the complete eradication of Humankind from the galaxy. Fortunately, the UNSC had previously created a <a href=\"/super-soldier/3015-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-90\">supersoldier</a> program to deal with terrorists, labelling the genetically-modified subjects \" <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">Spartans</a>,\" and equipping the super soldiers with a suit of power armour made of the most cutting edge technology available, that was soon made even more formidable with the addition of <a href=\"/energy-force-shield/3055-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-644\">energy shields</a> based on stolen Covenant technology.</p><p>In August of 2552, the Covenant find the planet <a href=\"/reach/3035-571/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-571\">Reach</a>, a major Human military stronghold, the second-most well protected planet after Earth herself, and assault the planet with a massive fleet. Reach falls, and most of the Spartans are lost in the battle.

The Covenant, however, withhold bombarding the Autumn with plasma weapons so close to the ring, and instead deploy infantry to board the cruiser. Just before the Covenant's arrival on-board, the Master Chief is awakened from cryo-sleep, from which he makes his way to the bridge, where Captain Keyes gives him his pistol. Keyes's plan is to crash-land the Autumn on the habitable ringworld. Before leaving, the Master Chief takes the chip that contains Cortana and inserts the chip into his MJOLNIR suit in order to prevent her from falling into Covenant hands. Together, the Master Chief and Cortana make their way through the quickly-deteriorating Autumn, toward the ship's escape pods, where the remaining marines on-board have prepared for evacuation. The Master Chief enters a escape pod, and it jettisons from the Pillar of Autumn as the cruiser careens into the atmosphere of the ring.</p><h3>Halo / Truth and Reconciliation / The Silent Cartographer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\"><img alt=\"Halo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 400w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 400w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo</figcaption></figure><p>The Master Chief's escape pod crash-lands onto the ring, killing all the marines within and knocking the Master Chief unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the Master Chief learns that other pods have landed safely within the vicinity and Cortana intercepts Covenant chatter revealing that the Covenant have seized the wreckage of the Autumn and have captured Captain Keyes himself, holding him prisoner aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Collecting what is left of the UNSC Marines, the Master Chief, <a href=\"/sergeant-major-avery-junior-johnson/3005-964/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-964\">Sergeant Avery Johnson</a>, and dropship pilot Carol Rawley (known in-game by her callsign \"Foe Hammer\") make a push for the Truth and Reconciliation, where they plan to rescue Keyes from capture. Upon meeting up with him again, Captain Keyes reveals that he has learned through eavesdropping on his captor's conversations that the Covenant call the ringworld \" <a href=\"/halo/3035-58/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo</a>,\" and that they deem it not only as a religious relic, but as a powerful superweapon, one with enough influence to give its manipulator the power to control the galaxy. Cortana remarks she had intercepted several transmissions referring to a \"control room,\" and that she assumed the Covenant were looking for a control room to a cruiser damaged in the battle above the ring. Instead, the Covenant are actually looking for Halo's control center. Cortana believes that the Humans can get there first if she can interface with a local mapping station referred to by the Covenant as the \"Silent Cartographer\".</p><p>Committed to stopping the Covenant before they find the Control Room, and reinvigorated after the successful invasion of the Truth and Reconciliation, the marines on Halo begin a large-scale assault for the Silent Cartographer. In the meantime, Keyes gains information regarding the location of a large Covenant weapons cache. Believing he and a group of marines led by Sergeant Johnson can seize the cache, he leaves to make his way there, without the Master Chief, who is sent to find and operate the Silent Cartographer. The Chief is successful in this mission, and learns the location of the Control Room, as Keyes and Johnson close in on the weapons cache, deep inside a dense jungle several hundred miles away from the Cartographer island.</p><h3>Assault on the Control Room / 343 Guilty Spark</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\"><img alt=\"Assault on the Control Room\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Assault on the Control Room\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Assault on the Control Room</figcaption></figure><p>Foe Hammer brings the Master Chief and Cortana as close as she can to the Control Room, where the Master Chief makes a push through heavy Covenant resistance--the heaviest yet seen on Halo--for the Control Room, which is a vast chamber with a holographic Halo rotating around the perimeter and central platform. Upon reaching the Control Room (and locking the Covenant out of it), the Master Chief removes Cortana's chip and uploads her into the terminal. She exclaims that the wealth of information is nearly intoxicating, even for an AI like herself, and mentions that an ancient alien race called the <a href=\"/the-forerunner/3015-80/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunners</a> built an array of Halos just like this one, millions of years ago. And as she uncovers this information, she stops abruptly. Horrified by something unknown to the Master Chief, she orders him to find Keyes and to stop him from opening the weapons cache \"before it is too late.\"</p><p>Leaving Cortana in the locked Control Room, the Master Chief and Foe Hammer hurry for the jungle. Once in the jungle, beneath the fog and foliage canopy, the Chief finds corpses of Covenant soldiers-- <a href=\"/grunts/3015-1331/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1331\">Grunts</a>, <a href=\"/jackals/3015-3379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3379\">Jackals</a>, and even <a href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites</a>--and an abandoned <a href=\"/pelican/3055-1038/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1038\">Pelican</a> dropship playing a looping distress message. Traversing the jungle, the Master Chief finds a facility nestled into the side of a bluff--the cache Keyes came to find. Inside the facility, the Chief finds little trace of Captain Keyes, Johnson, or the marines amongst the scattered and panicked Covenant troops and Covenant corpses, but finds massive amounts of alien blood splattering the walls, far more than would be created by being shot by Human weapons. Later, he comes across a single marine who appears to have lost his mind, shooting at anything that moves and telling \"those things\" to stay away from him, and that he won't let them get him. Deep within the facility, the Master Chief finds a heavy blast door locked from the outside by a UNSC tech-lock. Activating it, the Master Chief opens the door and finds a marine corpse slumped against the door. Another marine's helmet lies nearby on the ground, next to a large pool of blood. The Master Chief links up with the video feed from the missing marine's helmet, which shows Keyes and Johnson investigating the cache before being ambushed by a new, unidentified non-Covenant alien species. The video feed shows Keyes's group completely overrun by the pulpy creatures before the video ends abruptly, citing the marine's death as the cause for disruption.</p><p>Moments after viewing the feed, the Master Chief is ambushed by a massive swarm of the small, pulpy aliens, now accompanied by larger Combat Forms. The Combat Forms resemble--and, indeed, are--rotting Covenant and Human corpses, now under the control of the smaller Infection Forms. Fighting his way out to the jungle, killing both former enemies and allies now controlled by the parasite, the Master Chief exits the facility on the far side of the bluff, and is assisted by a number of airborne robots of unknown origin, armed with powerful laser weaponry that seems to be perfectly designed to destroy the mutated creatures. The leader of the robots (which are known as Sentinels) teleports the Master Chief to a raised position atop a gigantic tower, and introduces himself as <a href=\"/343-guilty-spark/3005-1190/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1190\">343 Guilty Spark</a>, the Monitor of Installation Zero-Four (the Forerunner term for this specific Halo, as there are seven total). Spark exclaims that someone--the Covenant, who he calls an impatient and overzealous group of aliens--has released <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">the Flood</a>, the parasitic lifeform now rampant upon the soil of Halo. Calling the Master Chief a \"Reclaimer,\" the Monitor states the only way to stop the Flood is to activate Halo itself, a task for which they require the Index, a Forerunner tech-key located within a tower called the Library.</p><h3>The Library / Two Betrayals</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\"><img alt=\"Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png 400w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"</figcaption></figure><p>The Monitor escorts the Master Chief through myriad waves of Flood Combat Forms, commenting that that the Chief's weapons are highly ineffective against the Flood, and makes several comments regarding the Master Chief's lack of preparedness for Flood containment protocols. On the way, Guilty Spark mentions that the Flood are contained on Halo for study, and that, in the case that the Flood escape Halo, they would consume all sentient life in the galaxy. Once at the Index, the Monitor absorbs the key's data, and teleports both himself and the Master Chief back to the Control Room.</p><p>When the pair arrive at Halo's Control Room, Cortana reappears in the terminal just as the Master Chief inserts the Index to activate the ring's weaponry. She impedes the process and uses her command of the ringworld's systems to temporarily disable the Monitor. Cortana derides the Master Chief for falling in step with Spark without knowing the full capability of Halo's power. \"Halo doesn't kill the Flood,\" Cortana explains, \"it kills their food. Human, Covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible.\"</p><p>The Chief questions the Monitor, who seems strangely confused that the Master Chief was ignorant to this knowledge--as though he should have known this before. When Cortana absorbs the Index's data and is reinserted into the MJOLNIR armor, the Monitor summons a squad of Sentinels to attack the Master Chief, who now fights a war on three fronts--Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels. Cortana and the Master Chief escape, and Cortana--having completely assimilated the vast breadth of Halo's information--tells the Master Chief that the only way to guarantee Halo cannot be fired, which would trigger the rest of the rings in the array and thus destroy all sentient life in the galaxy, is to destroy it entirely, and that the only way to destroy Halo is to detonate the fusion core inside the wreckage of the Pillar of Autumn, and that the only way to detonate the Autumn's core is with a special set of passcodes contained in a chip implanted in the brain of Captain Keyes. Therefore, he must be rescued at all costs.</p><p>The Master Chief destroys the three generators powering the majority of Halo's central functions, buying enough time for Cortana to find Keyes before the Monitor can reboot the ring's arsenal. With that done, she determines that Keyes--alive or dead--is on-board the now Flood-controlled Truth and Reconciliation.</p><h3>Keyes / The Maw</h3><p>Cortana manages to transport them to the Truth and Reconciliation via a teleportation tactic similar to that which the Monitor uses. Immediately, Keyes, sounding pained and on the verge of death, radios the Master Chief to turn back, to leave Halo by any means possible. The Flood, having completely overrun the ship, gather piles of Covenant corpses in the two largest rooms for some unknown purpose (later entries in the series imply that this was in preparation for the construction of a <a href=\"/gravemind/3005-996/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-996\">Gravemind</a>). And as the Chief makes his way toward Keyes, he learns that the Flood are repairing the Truth and Reconciliation, planning to leave Halo in order to consume more sentient life. The Chief finds Keyes, but finds him too late. Keyes is totally consumed by the Flood and has been absorbed into a large, fleshy growth of Flood tissue. Cortana remarks that Keyes wanted them to leave by any means possible, and the Master Chief obliges, punching his hand into the softened skull of the deceased captain, physically removing the chip from within. Black-armored Covenant special operatives arrive on the ship to thwart the Flood threat, and they are distraction enough for the Master Chief to hijack a Covenant <a href=\"/banshee/3055-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee</a> and escape the Truth and Reconciliation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\"><img alt=\"The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 800w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 800w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn</figcaption></figure><p>As the sun rises on Halo, the Master Chief's Banshee reaches the Autumn, which has already been occupied by Flood and Sentinel forces since the Flood incursion. At the Autumn's bridge, Cortana uses Keyes's chip to activate the self-destruct sequence, but it is stopped by the Monitor, who has taken full control of the ship's remaining functional systems. Although Cortana has finally run out of ideas, the Chief suggests they do it the old fashioned way: damage the fusion core using grenades or rockets, rendering it unstable to the point where detonation becomes inevitable.</p><p>The Master Chief fights through waves of Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels, all assaulting each other as well as the lone Spartan, who appears to be one of the only Humans left alive on Halo. After detonating the four reactors, the Chief successfully damages the fusion core and starts the inevitable chain reaction. Foe Hammer, having survived the Flood infection in her Pelican, tells the Master Chief to grab a Warthog from the vehicle depot and meet her at a landing pad just under a kilometer down the length of the ship, where she can extract him and Cortana and escape the destruction of Halo. Driving over Flood forms and dodging Sentinel laser cannons and Covenant plasma fire, the Chief makes it to the landing pad with minutes to spare, but Foe Hammer is ambushed by a pair of Covenant Banshees, and her Pelican crashes and explodes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\"><img alt=\"The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 800w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"</figcaption></figure><p>With no time to mourn their most recently slain friend, the Master Chief and Cortana make one final charge: a Longsword starfighter is docked at the far end of the ship, and if they can make it there in time, they can use it to escape Halo.

At this point Halo was intended to be a third-person-action game, in which a ship crash lands on a ring world and early versions of the <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">Covenant</a> aliens appear simply to loot what they can with the humans forced to resort to guerrilla warfare.</p><p>The first official trailer was shown at E3 2000 and was well received. One month later on June 19th 2000 Microsoft announced that it had acquired Bungie Studios; Halo had become an Xbox exclusive. Bungie rewrote the game's engine and the game became a first person shooter. Playable demos carried mixed reactions up to its release simultaneously with the Xbox on November 15th, 2001.</p><h2>Post-release</h2><h3>Halo Custom Edition</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1140282\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.43983402489627\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1140282\"><img alt=\"Halo: Custom Edition\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png 241w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo: Custom Edition\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1140282-picture_1.png 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo: Custom Edition</figcaption></figure><p>Halo: Custom Edition is a free expansion that requires a key code from Halo: Combat Evolved to be played.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Shalom: Knightmare III is an adventure game developed by <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a> for the <a href=\"/msx/3045-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX</a>, the third game in the Knightmare series. Taking place many years after after the previous games, the player controls a regular college student who is drawn into the Knightmare world by a cursed computer game, and told he must defeat the Demon King Gog before he can return home.</p><p>The game came out in Japan in 1987, but was never officially released anywhere else. An English fan translation, based on an earlier Portuguese version, was however made available in 2003.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game starts in the real world, as a young college student discovers his classmate has a copy of the newest Konami game - <i>Shalom: Knightmare III</i>. Nabbing it from her, he quickly boots it up, only to find himself drawn into the computer. Everything goes black, and as he wakes up, he is greeted by Butako, a talking pig, who informs him the game was cursed, and that he is trapped inside of its world until he can stop the Demon King Gog.</p><p>It has been decades since the events of the previous Knightmare games, and Popolon and Aphrodite have long since passed. Their son, Pampas, now rules the Greek Realm as king, but he is old, sick and bedridden. Butako leads the student to him, and the king believes the newcomer to be their savior, telling the him of the prophecy of Gog's return, and warning him that 8 of the demon's lieutenants have already come to prepare for their master's arrival. The king also asks for an additional favor, that the student look for his daughter, Princess Chelsea, who has been missing for over two weeks.</p><p>Unfazed by all that's happened, the student sets out to find clues as to where the Princess and the 8 demon henchmen could be, with Butako tagging along.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Shalom is an adventure game and, aside from the boss battles, contains no combat, making it quite unlike its predecessors. Instead, the player must talk to the inhabitants of the world to gather clues, find items, and solve puzzles to track down and defeat the 8 demon servants of Gog.</p><p>The game uses a slightly skewed top-down perspective, and a tiled <a href=\"/flip-screen/3015-2123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2123\">flip screen</a> world map. It generally leaves the player free to explore all available areas in any order, but new areas are typically only accessible after the next demon has been defeated. Games can be saved at any of the 10 monks scattered throughout the world, using disk or tape storage, or a 130 character password. Death is rare, though can happen if the player fails certain puzzles, falls into certain holes, or is defeated by a boss.</p><p>All interaction with the world is done though a command menu. The commands will target the tile in front of the player character, and an invalid target will usually result in a mocking response from Butako, though occasionally she will provide hints or trigger story progress.</p><h3>Commands</h3><ul><li>TALK - Converse with the target. Some characters will have additional dialog if used several times.</li><li>LOOK - Look at the target.</li><li>EXAMINE - Physically examine the target.</li><li>GET - Take an item.</li><li>USE - Use an item from the inventory on the target.</li><li>SHOW - Show the target an item from the inventory.</li><li>GIVE - Give the target an item from the inventory.</li><li>TO DO - A special contextual command that gives access to additional commands when used at the right time.</li></ul><h3>Boss fights</h3><p>The boss fights differ from the rest of the game, as they present the player with a mini-game to overcome. Several are simple side-view action platformers, reminiscent of <a href=\"/knightmare-ii-the-maze-of-galious/3030-20383/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20383\">Knightmare II</a>, where the player must throw knives at the boss' vulnerable part while dodging his attacks. Others provide a similar fight in the top down perspective of the main game, draw in gameplay from other well known game types like <a href=\"/breakout/3030-13049/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\">Breakout</a> or sliding block puzzles, or must be overcome using the command menu.</p><h3>Fourth wall</h3><p>Aside from the main conceit of the main character being a gamer from the \"real world\", the game does break the <a href=\"/breaking-the-fourth-wall/3015-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-138\">fourth wall</a> occasionally, requiring the player to take actions outside of the game world to progress. After getting swallowed by quicksand for example, the player is faced with a game over screen, but can get rescued if he presses the question mark key, as certain characters will advise him.</p><p>Shortly afterwards the player is face with a broken bridge, which only becomes usable after the player saves and then loads the game. And an optional quest at the aptly named Reset Village even goes as far as resetting the system if the player tries to complete it without meeting all its criteria.</p>",

Under the new system, once <a href=\"/shield-regeneration/3015-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">shields</a> have been depleted, the player can only take a few hits until death, but once shields recharge, health resets. This is explained through the new Mark VI suit, which injects bio-foam directly into the wearer's wounds. <a href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">Active Camo</a> has been removed as an item. Instead, the Arbiter has a rechargeable version of Camo, instead of a <a href=\"/flashlight/3055-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlight</a> like the Chief. Another new addition is <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual wielding</a> certain weapons, including the <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, the new <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">SMG</a>, the <a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">needler</a>, the <a href=\"/plasma-pistol/3055-119/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-119\">plasma pistol</a>, and the <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">plasma rifle</a>. When dual wielding, weapons take longer to reload and the ability to throw <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades</a> is taken out. Another newly added mechanic is the ability to board enemy vehicles when they are near the player and travelling at low speeds.</p><p>The most noticeable change in the weapons is the absence of the iconic <a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">assault rifle</a>. It is replaced by the new <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">battle rifle</a>; a three shot burst weapon with a 2x scope. The Covenant equivalent of the battle rifle is the <a href=\"/covenant-carbine/3055-137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-137\">carbine</a>; a semi-automatic weapon that also has a 2x scope (the carbine uses <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammo</a> instead of battery power). In addition to the battle rifle and carbine, there is now the SMG (a small compact fully automatic weapon), a new pistol with no scope, the <a href=\"/brute-shot/3055-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-123\">brute shot</a> (Covenant <a href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher</a>), a <a href=\"/brute-plasma-rifle/3055-1105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1105\">brute plasma rifle</a> (which fires faster than the regular plasma rifle), an improved <a href=\"/m41-rocket-launcher/3055-134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\">rocket launcher</a> (which locks onto enemy vehicles), and the <a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">energy sword</a> (which can now be used by the player).</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Compared to Halo: Combat Evolved, there have been some noticeable changes in the arsenals of both Human and Covenant forces. The <a href=\"/ma5b-assault-rifle/3055-5594/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5594\">MA5-series Assault Rifle</a> has been absent, replaced by both the <a href=\"/m7-smg/3055-126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-126\">M7 Submachine Gun</a> and <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">BR55 Battle Rifle</a>. The <a href=\"/m6d-pistol/3055-2806/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2806\">M6D Magnum</a> has also been replaced by the weaker M6C Magnum. The Covenant now have new tools in their disposal: the semi-automatic Covenant Carbine, the long-ranged Particle Beam Rifle, the Brute Plasma Rifle, and the explosive Brute Shot. Players can now carry the Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword into combat, as well as equip the mysterious Sentinel Beam.</p><h4>Human Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/m6c-magnum/3055-2807/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\"><b>Magnum</b></a> - A semi-automatic <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">handgun</a> useful for short-to-medium ranged combat.

Very accurate and has barely any recoil. Each clip contains 36 rounds (12 bursts) and players can carry up to 108 rounds (36 bursts). Useful for medium-to-long ranged combat. Formally known as the \"BR55 Battle Rifle\".</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/m90-shotgun/3055-127/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-127\"><b>Shotgun</b></a> - A <a href=\"/pump-action-shotgun/3055-3959/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3959\">pump-action</a><a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun</a> that is deadly in close-ranged combat.

The game had many advanced features including <a href=\"/matchmaking/3015-3334/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3334\">matchmaking</a>, <a href=\"/voice-chat/3015-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-648\">voice chat</a>, and <a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">rankings</a>. There was also some customization implemented into the game as well, which created a lot of <a href=\"/user-generated-content/3015-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-129\">user created content</a>. Many games came out of these customization options, such as Tremors, Troy, Vehicle Wars and the most popular being <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">Zombies</a> which grew so popular Bungie saw fit to put it into Halo 3. Players really enjoyed the customization options and kept many players sticking around even after getting their fill of matchmaking. The match making games were very competitive in Halo 2 due to the intensive ranking system. The way the ranking system in Halo 2 works is when the player first starts playing the game they start at level 1 and as they win matches their level increases. If they lose enough matches they can drop levels. These ranking were taken very seriously by the Halo 2 community. The color of the level a player had was very important to most Halo 2 fanatics. They can see what the levels look like in the picture below.</p><p>Levels 44-50 were \"secret\" levels -- they were picture of various things, such as the moon or the halo ring.</p><p>Halo 2 had 24 maps the people could play online and was the most played game ever on Xbox Live. Even after the Xbox 360 was released Halo 2 still remained the most popular. The first game to top the amount of online players Halo 2 had each month, was the original <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>.</p><h3>Clans</h3><p>Halo 2 is one of the few Xbox games (and is the only game in the series) to support a dedicated in-game <a href=\"/clan/3015-643/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-643\">\"clan\"</a> system, where players can form named groups outside of the \"friends list\" system both to find games easier and to combat other Clans. Clans have a 100-member limit and must be invited by qualified Clan members.</p><p>There are four types of clanmates, each with their own hierarchy and privileges: <strong>Overlords</strong>, <strong>Staff</strong>, <strong>Members</strong>, and <strong>Peons</strong>. All clanmates can participate in Clan matches and can invite other players to join the Clan (with the exception of Peons). Overlords and Staff can promote/demote Members and Peons, as well as boot them from the clan. Overlords can do the same thing with Staff.</p><h3>Matchmaking Playlists</h3><ul><li>Rumble Pit</li><li>Double Team</li><li>Team Slayer</li><li>Team Skirmish</li><li>Team Training</li><li>Team Snipers</li><li>Team Hardcore</li><li>Big Team Battle</li><li>Team SWAT</li><li>H2 Challenge</li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-549346\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-549346\"><img alt=\"Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/8272/549346-coagulation.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some maps are remakes of those from Halo: Combat Evolved, such as this remake of fan-favorite Blood Gulch.</figcaption></figure><p>The Xbox version of Halo 2 included 12 multiplayer maps, two of which are remakes from <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.

As players began to practice these glitches and become well-versed in executing them they gained a much more significant place in the <a href=\"/meta-game/3015-905/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-905\">meta-game</a>, with some of the weapon-based glitches becoming essential for success against the higher ranking players. While game creator Bungie officially decreed on several occasions that a player's use of glitches for personal gain, in a Matchmaking setting, was a form of cheating, the developer had no way of tracking the use of such glitches by players. Ultimately, there were no widespread punishments or repercussions handed-down to players who utilized these glitches.</p><p>Some of the most noteworthy glitches:</p><h3><a href=\"/bxr/3015-2751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2751\"><b>BXR</b></a></h3><p>Commonly used in conjunction with the <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">Battle Rifle</a> (though possible to execute with any reloadable weapon) the BXR was a weapon animation glitch that allowed for a nearly instantaneous close-ranged kill. The glitch became very widespread among the highest ranks of players as the meta-game progressed.</p><h3>Quick Reload (YY)</h3><p>Another glitch commonly used among higher-caliber players, the Quick Reload glitch was a weapon animation glitch that shaved precious seconds off of a player's reload time, allowing them to fire their weapon again sooner than they normally would with the default reload. The glitch was only possible when a player was carrying a secondary weapon. The move was executed by the player pressing the Y button twice in quick succession as soon as the reload animation reached the point where the in-game character began to insert a new clip into the weapon. If done properly the player will quickly switch to their secondary weapon and then back to their primary, eliminating the rest of the reload animation while still giving the player a full clip.</p><h3>Double Melee (BXB)</h3><p>A third weapon animation glitch, the BXB was used to give players a significant advantage in close-range combat. Executed by pressing B, X, B in quick succession (under the default controller settings), the glitch allowed players to melee twice in a much shorter time span than if they were simply to press the melee button two times. Contrary to the BXR, which required a full clip of ammo to execute properly, the BXB required the player to have a partially depleted or empty ammo clip in their primary weapon. As with the other weapon glitches, the BXB saw very widespread use among the top-tier players.</p><h3>Double Shot (RRX)</h3><p>One of the most popular glitches among <a href=\"/major-league-gaming/3015-1858/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1858\">MLG</a> fans and players, the Double Shot was a glitch that was used primarily with the Battle Rifle that allowed players to fire two of the weapon's 3-shot bursts in one shot, resulting in 6 bullets being fired at once. The downside to this glitch was that after successfully firing a Double Shot, there was a significant span of time (roughly two to three seconds) where the player could not fire their weapon, and could only attack if they threw a grenade, used a melee attack, or switched to a secondary weapon. For this reason players would often hold off on using a Double Shot unless they were one or several \"shots down\" in a BR fight, or had a secondary weapon that they could \"YY\" with to cancel the long delay after a successful double shot.</p><h3>Quad Shot (RRXYYRRX)</h3><p>Similar to the double shot the quad shot, if done right, can shoot 4 shots out of the BR in half the time it normally would take. To do this the player need two weapons, first they start out with their double shot then they press \"YY\" really fast in order to cancel the reload; if they double shot correctly they will notice the reload animation isn't playing but it is still reloading in the background (this is normal so don't worry), now after pressing \"YY\" do another double shot, and with much practice the player can do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCEZz1zS3aQ\" rel=\"nofollow \">this</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/super-bouncing/3015-401/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-401\">Super Bouncing</a> (also known as Super Jumping)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7421875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\"><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"></noscript></a><figcaption>A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.</figcaption></figure><p>A glitch in the game's <a href=\"/havok-physics/3015-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok</a> physics engine that makes it possible for players to \"bounce\" to extreme heights, enabling them to reach previously inaccessible and out-of-bounds regions on a multiplayer map. The glitch was used quite frequently in a Matchmaking setting to give a player or team a significant advantage through an unreachable hiding spot or unfair vantage point.</p><h3>Sword Canceling (Butterflying)</h3><p>Sword canceling is a glitch that takes advantage of the \"lunge\" effect that the Energy Sword provides for the player. By aiming at an opponent with the Energy Sword at a close enough proximity for the reticule to light up red, then pressing the Right Trigger and X in quick succession, a player can achieve the normal Sword lunge without in any way damaging their opponent. The glitch is most commonly used to give players a means of reaching previously inaccessible ledges or areas of a map. The glitch earned the nickname \"Butterflying\" due to the strange, butterfly-like motion of the character model's arms when performing the sword cancel.</p><h3>Rocket Sword Glitch</h3><p>A glitch that would require a sword and a rocket launcher as a secondary. The player would look at an enemy from a distance and rapidly alternate pressing \"Y\" and \"B\" and they would launch towards the person they were aiming at from afar.</p><h2>Cheating</h2><p>As with most online games, Halo 2's online environment featured some players who manipulated and modified certain aspects of the game to provide themselves with an unfair advantage over their opponents. Players cheated most commonly in matchmaking playlists, so that they could more easily obtain a matchmaking rank that players would see associated with their gamertag. The highest-level matchmaking ranks, that featured symbols in place of numbers (ranks 44-50), were the most desirable and most sought after ranks to cheaters; therefore, non-cheaters often found it very difficult to play a legitimate, cheat-free match at the highest ranks. There were several different methods of cheating, each with different effects on gameplay.</p><h3>Modding</h3><p>Achieved through the use of cheat-devices such as Action Replay, Modding was the most common, game-changing form of cheating. \"Modders\" manipulated map files and gametypes to create gameplay that was well-outside the normal limits placed by the game engine. Common modded elements were changes in player speed and gravity, changed weapon properties (such as <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">Plasma Rifles</a> that fired <a href=\"/wraith/3055-531/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-531\">Wraith</a> projectiles), and changed vehicle properties (flying <a href=\"/m12-warthog/3055-193/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-193\">Warthogs</a>, flying turrets, faster <a href=\"/scorpion/3055-760/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-760\">Scorpions</a>, etc.). Due to the dramatic, game-changing effects of modding, it was fairly easy for Bungie's automated banning tool -- notoriously dubbed the \"Banhammer\" by players and Bungie staff -- to detect and ban players who used modded files in matchmade games. Most \"modders\" had only a few hours, at most, to rise through the matchmaking ranks before being faced with a permanent ban, and a vast majority of modders were inevitably banned. The problem was that there were so many free two-month Xbox Live trials available, it was easy for a modder to quickly make another account.</p><h3>Standbying</h3><p>The second most game-changing form of cheating, behind Modding, was known as Standbying. Making use of the game's host-based server system, standbying was achieved by having the \"host\" player manipulate their internet connection to cause problems for the other players in the match. When the host managed to successfully tamper with their connection, it would cause all of the other players in the game to experience enormous amounts of lag. The host's Xbox was immune to the lag issues, and could travel around the map killing enemy players or completing game objectives without much, if any, opposition. Though the Standby glitch was originally achieved by players manually pressing the \"Standby\" button on their router, modem, or switch, eventually players used various computer software so that they could throttle the connections of only the opposing team, giving all of their teammates a reprieve from the negative effects of the glitch. Eventually, Bungie improved the banhammer to better detect and control \"standbyers\" in matchmaking.</p><h3>Bridging</h3><p>Bridging was a method of controlling \"host\" in a matchmaking game, and, more specifically, a way of ensuring that a certain player in the game always received host. Unlike modding and standbying, though, bridging was not a very detrimental form of cheating on its own. Bridging was accomplished through the use of specific Firewall software that controlled the ports and incoming IP Addresses for a player's router or switch. By using the program with the correct settings, a player could be ensured of being host for every game they played. Also, due to the nature of the glitch, bridgers could not be matched with or against other bridgers, so the bridging player always decided who received host. While Bridging was used in conjunction with Standbying or Modding to ensure that those forms of cheating worked as efficiently as possible by giving a certain player host, it was also used as a preventative measure against cheaters. Some players used bridging to make sure that no nefarious players could obtain host, therefore ensuring a quality match experience. As of the 1.6 update for Halo 2, the most common methods of Bridging were no longer effective or possible in matchmaking.</p><h2><b>Soundtrack</b></h2><p>The Halo 2 Original Soundtrack was released in two volumes, composed by <a href=\"/martin-odonnell/3040-1741/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1741\">Martin O'Donnel</a> and <a href=\"/michael-salvatori/3040-1742/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1742\">Michael Salvatori</a>.

The game also includes new vehicles, including the UNSC's mobile transport <a href=\"/mongoose/3055-803/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-803\">Mongoose</a> and the Brute's attack motorbike <a href=\"/brute-chopper/3055-801/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-801\">Chopper</a>.</p><p>The game also includes various improvements to Halo 2's multiplayer aspect. Players can now customize the armor permutations (including helmet, shoulders, and torso) for both their Spartan and Elite soldiers (each of which must be earned by completing goals and achievements throughout the game). Players can now be easily identified by their allies in-game through a custom Service Tag (composed of a letter followed by two numbers). Halo 3 includes a more robust matchmaking system with the TrueSkill ranking system, a new experience system (with a special ranking system in which players can earn different \"grades\" depending on their TrueSkill rank and experience points), special playlists (including playlists that grant double experience points), and the option to veto the first given map/gametype combination. The game now includes a special Theater Mode (where players can watch game replays and crop them into smaller film clips or take screenshots) and <a href=\"/forge/3015-1929/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1929\">Forge Mode</a> (a unique <a href=\"/in-game-map-editor/3015-269/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-269\">in-game map editor</a> where players can alter the placement of any weapon, spawn, item, or structure on any map) While the clan system from Halo 2 was removed, Halo 3 includes a new File Share system, in which players can upload custom gametype variants, film clips, screenshots, and \"Forged\" map variants into Bungie's servers, so that they can be downloaded by other players.</p><p>The Multiplayer portion of the game was later bundled with <a href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST</a> (as \"Halo 3: Complete Multiplayer Experience\" or \"Halo 3: Mythic\") with all DLC maps included (including three timed-exclusive maps).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Mechanics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483947\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5978/483947-carzy1337.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"185\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 185px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5978/483947-carzy1337.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483947\"><img alt=\"One of tens of thousands of multiplayer armour permutations.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5978/483947-carzy1337.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5978/483947-carzy1337.jpg 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px\" data-width=\"185\"></a><figcaption>One of tens of thousands of multiplayer armour permutations.</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay in Halo 3 has undergone some significant changes compared to its predecessors, including simple tweaks to make it more cohesive. Master Chief may now carry \"equipment,\" which can range from a portable <a href=\"/gravity-lift/3055-1068/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1068\">gravity lift</a>, allowing the player to lift himself into the air, to a <a href=\"/bubble-shield/3055-1066/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1066\">bubble-shield</a>, which will spawn a clear, protective bubble around whoever decides to throw it down, as well as deployable cover, which projects a small blue defense shield, as well as many others. Bungie has assigned these special abilities to the \"X\" button, which was previously used to reload. Players now use the RB (right bumper) to reload the main weapon and LB for the secondary weapon if they are dual-wielding, although they can decide to use one of several other pre-made control schemes.</p><h3>The Load-Out</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874123\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.9336734693878\" data-width=\"392\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 392px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:193.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874123\"><img alt=\"A player brandishing the Recon Armor, formerly given to exceptional community members.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-width=\"330\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg 392w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg 330w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A player brandishing the Recon Armor, formerly given to exceptional community members.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg 392w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28248/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-width=\"330\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A player brandishing the Recon Armor, formerly given to exceptional community members.</figcaption></figure><p>Bungie has added a different version of the original <a href=\"/ag36-assault-rifle/3055-616/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-616\">Assault Rifle</a> (it has about half the clip size of the version in Halo: Combat Evolved, but it deals a little more damage and has better accuracy), strengthened the <a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">Needler</a> (though it can no longer be dual-wielded), and also included some new weapons like the <a href=\"/brute-spike-rifle/3055-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-139\">Spikers</a> (Brute sub-machine guns) and the <a href=\"/gravity-hammer/3055-128/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-128\">Gravity Hammer</a> (the Brute counterpart of the Elite <a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">Energy Sword</a>). There are also 2 new grenade classes: The <a href=\"/brute-spike-grenade/3055-849/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-849\">Spike Grenade</a> and the <a href=\"/incendiary-cannon/3055-1302/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1302\">Incendiary Grenade</a> (AKA the firebomb grenade). The former is a Brute-made grenade that sticks to objects before sending razor-sharp spikes flying in the direction of the blast, and the latter a UNSC weapon especially useful against the zombie-like Flood. Bungie also reduced the load-out on each grenade from the previous four, to two, allowing players to carry a total of eight grenades and switch between the types with the left bumper (when not dual-wielding). A player may also pick up turrets and flamethrowers, but by using them he/she will switch into a 3rd person view, in which movement will be slightly restricted and ammo will become limited. There are also a few new vehicles like the <a href=\"/mongoose/3055-803/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-803\">Mongoose</a>, a quadbike with two seats, the <a href=\"/hornet/3055-534/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-534\">Hornet</a>, which is the human equivalent to the <a href=\"/banshee/3055-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee</a>, and the <a href=\"/brute-chopper/3055-801/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-801\">Chopper</a>, which resembles the <a href=\"/ghost/3055-371/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-371\">Ghost</a> in that it has only one seat and can fire front-mounted cannons. One final new vehicle, the <a href=\"/m312-elephant-hrv/3055-1230/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1230\">Elephant</a>, is an enormous, invincible mobile base armed with two turrets. The Elephant appears only in the multiplayer level 'Sand Trap', and serves as each team's flag base in Capture the Flag mode, allowing players to actually move their flag around the level, albeit at a painfully slow pace.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-843770\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-843770\"><img alt=\"Multiplayer gameplay on the Mythic map, \"Assembly\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7439/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7439/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg 800w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7439/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Multiplayer gameplay on the Mythic map, \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiplayer gameplay on the Mythic map, \"Assembly\"</figcaption></figure><p>Halo 3's campaign can be played co-operatively, locally, through System Link, and online on Xbox Live with up to four players, although only two players may play on a single Xbox 360. Unlike previous games, which just doubled the primary character, each player in Halo 3 is given a unique character; player one controls the Master Chief, player two controls the Arbiter (with small changes to the dialogue and cutscenes to reflect the fact that the Arbiter never leaves the Chief) and players three and four controlling unique Elites, who never speak and do not show up in cutscenes, though Bungie has named them <a href=\"/ntho-sraom/3005-6622/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6622\">N'tho 'Sraom</a> and <a href=\"/usze-taham/3005-6621/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6621\">Usze 'Taham</a>, respectively. In addition, Halo 3 can also be played competitively through a matchmaking service or in custom, user-created games. In matchmaking, players are matched with up to fifteen other players based on their rank and skill level in the individual \"playlists\", which are categorized into two groups depending on their overall purpose. Ranked playlists are used to match players based on their Trueskill rating. Social playlists allow players to play with others with no ranking system involved for each playlist, although Experience and overall skill still determines player match-ups. Few of the original achievements work in social matches, but the <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC</a> achievements all are unlockable in social playlists. One can also still earn Experience for the playlists, as well as global and playlist-specific Experience points (EXP). Finally, every weekend, Double Experience Weekend begins that focus on a very specific playstyle or gametype, including Grifball and Infection. The playlists are:</p><h4>Ranked</h4><ul><li><b>Lone Wolves - </b>Matches include 6 players and use free-for-all game modes, like Slayer, Swords, Slayer BRs, Crazy King, and Oddball.</li><li><b>Team Slayer - </b>Matches are team-based and usually include 6 or 8 players in 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 games.

Skill levels are increased when the player wins ranked games. EXP is gained from simply winning games which can be either ranked or unranked.

From vehicle and weapon placement to fusion coils and equipment placement, just about everything the player can use and interact with on a map can be moved, tweaked, and adjusted to the player's liking. Once completed, all forged maps can be put on the player's file share and uploaded to Bungie.net were other players can download, comment, tag, and share their creations over the Internet. The recent maps Foundry (From the Heroic Map Pack) and Sandbox (From the Mythic Map Pack) were made specifically to cater to users of Forge. Many forging communities have arisen in the wake of these two maps releases, creating a massive number of user-generated maps. Bungie has recently taken notice of this user-generated content and has incorporated several Forge maps created in Foundry and Sandbox into both Ranked and Social matchmaking. Bungie has also regularly featured maps created by the community in their weekly updates and included interviews with their creators. A few special features of the Forge have been included in recent map packs as well, from different color affects to the Killball.</p><h3>Theater</h3><p>The Theater is a powerful tool allowing the viewing and saving of previously played campaign missions and multiplayer matches. The system used to create the video allows the video to maintain a size of mere kilobytes. The Theater can be used to take screenshots, save film clips, and save whole films. The camera in the Theater is not limited to a body either. The camera can be moved to any player or free-floated anywhere in the map, allowing for interesting angles and screenshots.</p><h3>Screenshots</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197338\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1536\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1536px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197338\"><img alt=\"A User Created Screenshot\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 1536w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A User Created Screenshot\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 1536w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5978/197338-32619830_full.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A User Created Screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>With the use of theater mode, users can take screenshots of their favorite moments and upload them to Bungie.net. There, players can also comment, rate, and download other users' screenshots. Bungie has used screenshots uploaded to Bungie.net in their Weekly updates.</p><h3>Saved Films</h3><p>While watching a match in Theater, people can save entire custom and matchmaking games or cut out specific parts to make video clips. These videos can then be watched through Theater by anyone who has downloaded the file from the user's File Share. Plus, as the Theater records gameplay information and not video, matches can be viewed from any angle. Unfortunately, for the same reason, the Theater clips cannot be viewed online (although the Bungie Pro Video feature alleviates this problem, see below), although the player can set a video to download the next time they play Halo 3.</p><h3>File Share</h3><p>The File Share is available for every Halo 3 user and allows them to upload their files for others to view and download at no cost. These slots can include Films, Film Clips, Screenshots, Map Variants, Gametypes or any combination. The standard capacity for the File Share is six slots and/or 25MB, although this can be upgraded to 24 slots and 250MB via the pay service called Bungie Pro (see below).</p><h3>Bungie Pro</h3><p>Bungie Pro enables a number of premium features to the Halo 3 user, including an expansion of storage for the Halo 3 File Share (see above) and the ability to use Bungie Pro Video (see below). A 12-Month Bungie Pro subscription can be purchased over Xbox Live for 750 MS Points. At the end of the subscription, the player will be asked to whether they want to renew their subscription or not. For a limited time, a trial of Bungie Pro was given as a gift to people who downloaded the Legendary Map Pack or Mythic Map Pack. The trial lasted roughly 4 months.</p><h3>Bungie Pro Video</h3><p>As of now Bungie Pro comes bundled with Bungie Pro Video. Bungie Pro Video allows the player take their game film clips (which, as they are purely game data, require Halo 3 to be viewed) and turn them into videos they can watch on their computer using the .wmv format. Users are allowed 5 render minutes a month, which expire at the end of the month. Bungie has stated that users will soon be able to buy render minutes using the File Share menu at 10 minutes for 100 MSP ($1.25).</p><h2>Skulls</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428990\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"444\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 444px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428990\"><img alt=\"A Halo 3 Skull\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg 444w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Halo 3 Skull\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg 444w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/319/428990-26998835_medium.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Halo 3 Skull</figcaption></figure><p>Human <a href=\"/skull/3055-641/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-641\">skulls</a> can be found tucked away in odd corners of the Halo 3 campaign. Each one has some kind of effect on the game that can be turned on or off at the beginning of a play session. In doing so, Bungie has expanded the original skulls \"Easter Egg\" from Halo 2. In Halo 3, when the player finds a skull they can turn it on and off at will, as opposed to having to start a new save to turn it off. There are four \"silver skulls\" which don't give an achievement but go towards unlocking the Hayabusa armor, and nine \"gold skulls\" which each have their own achievement and go towards unlocking the Hayabusa armor.</p><h3>Silver Skulls</h3><ul><li>Cowbell Skull - Makes explosions larger.</li><li>Grunt Birthday Party Skull - When Grunts are shot in the head, their head explodes and confetti flies out. There is also the sound of children cheering.</li><li>IWHBYD Skull - Activates new, often humorous dialogue in the game.</li><li>Blind Skull - Removes the reticule, shield bar, ammo count, etc. from the HUD.</li></ul><h3>Gold Skulls</h3><ul><li>Catch Skull - Makes enemies use grenades more often and also drop more when killed. Friendly units will also throw grenades more often.</li><li>Iron Skull - If playing the campaign singleplayer, death will send the player back to the beginning of the level. In co-op, the death of a single player takes all players back to the last checkpoint, similarly to playing Halo 2 on the Legendary difficulty.</li><li>Black Eye Skull - The shields don't recharge unless the player melees attack enemies.</li><li>Tough Luck Skull - Enemies are better at dodging explosions and vehicles.</li><li>Fog Skull - Removes the motion sensor.</li><li>Famine Skull - Makes dropped weapons supply with less ammo. This does not include weapons on weapon racks or certain weapons \"planted\" by Bungie for the player to use.</li><li>Thunderstorm Skull - Enemies' ranks are higher. Higher ranked enemies take more damage.</li><li>Tilt Skull - Enemies are more resistant to certain weapons. Even ordinarily, plasma weapons deal more damage to energy shields than to flesh, while the opposite is true for bullet-based weapons. With the skull on, shielded enemies will take dramatically less damage from bullet weapons and unshielded enemies will take dramatically less damage from plasma weapons. This includes vehicle weapons, such that a Plasma Rifle can take down a Brute's shields before a Warthog LAAG turret can, but this is much less noticeable in a tank.</li><li>Mythic Skull - Enemies have double health.</li></ul><p>Guides are available on Giant Bomb to aid in locating each skull. Additionally, six more skulls were can be found in each multiplayer map added in the downloadable Mythic Map Pack, and also in the three maps be packed in with <a href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST</a>, with one skull per map. These skulls do not have any effects, and their only benefit is the Vidmaster achievement for finding all of them (meaning they are therefore required to achieve the coveted Recon armor).</p><h3>Multiplayer Map Skulls</h3><ul><li>Assembly Skull - This skull is located in the center of the map, up top, in between the big purple arm and the middle post. As with all the Mythic skulls, the player must be in Forge to obtain it.</li><li>Orbital Skull - This skull is located above the pit in the middle of the map, it is a few floors up and hidden under and overhang. As with all the Mythic skulls, the player must be in Forge to obtain it.</li><li>Sandbox Skull - This skull is located at the back of the dunes, in between the guardians towers. There are many custom maps the player can download with the towers shut off so they can just fly out and grab it. As with all the Mythic skulls, the player must be in Forge to obtain it.</li><li>Citadel Skull</li><li>Heretic Skull</li><li>Longshore Skull</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The original soundtrack to Halo 3 was composed by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori and was released a few months after the game in a two disc set.</p><h3>Tracklist:</h3><h3>Disc 1</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-955235\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33881/955235-halo_3_original_soundtrack.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33881/955235-halo_3_original_soundtrack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-955235\"><img alt=\"Soundtrack Box Art\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33881/955235-halo_3_original_soundtrack.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33881/955235-halo_3_original_soundtrack.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Soundtrack Box Art\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33881/955235-halo_3_original_soundtrack.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33881/955235-halo_3_original_soundtrack.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Soundtrack Box Art</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Luck (3:25)</li><li>Released (5:20)</li><li>Infiltrate (3:49)</li><li>Honorable Intentions (2:46)</li><li>Last of the Brave (3:57)</li><li>Brutes (5:07)</li><li>Out of Shadow (4:37)</li><li>To Kill a Demon (3:44)</li><li>This is Our Land (4:00)</li><li>This is the Hour (2:08)</li><li>Dread Intrusion (5:25)</li><li>Follow Our Brothers (3:25)</li><li>Farthest Outpost (5:14)</li><li>Behold a Pale Horse (5:38)</li><li>Edge Closer (3:03)</li></ol><h3>Disc 2</h3><ol><li>Three Gates (4:34)</li><li>Black Tower (6:03)</li><li>One Final Effort (3:08)</li><li>Gravemind (5:21)</li><li>No More Dead Heroes (5:01)</li><li>Keep What You Steal (2:36)</li><li>Halo Reborn (3:59)</li><li>Greatest Journey (4:52)</li><li>Tribute (2:52)</li><li>Roll Call (5:58)</li><li>Wake Me When You Need Me (2:19)</li><li>Legend (0:40)</li><li>Choose Wisely (1:18)</li><li>Movement (0:27)</li><li>Never Forget (3:07)</li><li>Finish the Fight (2:27)</li></ol><h2>Title Update 1</h2><h3>Melee</h3><p>In Bungie's first mandatory Title Update, they fixed what many players were complaining about at the time, the melee system. Previously, if two players melee'd each other at the same time, the player with more shielding would die and there was a two second window that the system considered \"same time.\" Due to the high level of complaints, Bungie came up with a new Melee system. The \"same time\" window was closed to about a second and the kill would often go to the player that hit first, but if the game determined that both players hit at the same time, both players would die, ending in a somewhat humorous death as both players flopped backwards.</p><h2>Title Update 2</h2><h3>Ranking</h3><p>In their online Weekly Update for August 1st, 2008, Bungie unveiled a new addition to the online ranking system to be implemented in the second mandatory Title Update for Halo 3. The post included a chart illustrating EXP progression in various matchmaking playlists. The update offers players another visual representation of their progress in the online game, and serves to display precisely how many victories they have earned in any given matchmaking playlist.</p><p>This is achieved by adding a new layer of specificity to the tracking of player EXP (EXP is a value that serves to illustrate how seasoned a player is in matchmade games). While a player's online Service Record still reflects their total EXP value, under the new ranking system, the player also has a visual EXP value (in the form of the same military ranks that previously existed in the online game) for each individual playlist. To clarify, this means that as a player wins more games in a particular playlist their overall EXP value responds as it normally would, but they also progress through the Halo 3 military ranks specific to that playlist. An example: A player may fancy the Team Slayer hopper over all others, and after some time and enough wins, obtain an EXP rank of General in the playlist -- however, if said player has only been competing in the Team Slayer playlist, they will have a playlist military rank of Recruit in the other playlists that they've been ignoring.</p><p>A common misconception among Halo fans after the announcement of this news was that the hard-fought rankings that they had toiled away for since first setting foot online would be made meaningless after the release of the update, because now any player who invested enough time in a certain playlist would reach the esteemed upper ranks in a much easier fashion. This concern was later proven to be immaterial, because no aspect of the previous ranking system was being modified, and the individual playlist rankings were not to be reflected in a player's Service Record.</p><h3>Map Variants</h3><p>The Title Update also introduced four new variants of existing maps, out of Epitaph came Epilogue, and out of Snowbound came Boundless. While Epilogue is entirely without shield doors, Boundless still has those in High and Low base middle entrances (to counter the possibility of grenade spamming). These new maps will replace the existing ones; they will appear in matchmaking simultaneously, however in the long run Bungie hopes to have these maps become the dominant set. In addition to these two, Sand Tarp is now a version of Sand Trap without the Elephant vehicle and with new flag capture spaces. Pit Stop is a new version of The Pit with the upper spawn areas now inaccessible. These same matchmaking policies apply to these two as well. These maps are treated as Forge variants by the game, and can therefore be played normally and saved to an Xbox 360 Hard Drive.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p>Halo 3 requires 5.7 GB of HDD space to be installed. However, Bungie has recommended players to not install the game, saying that due to optimizations made to the game (so that it can be played on Xbox 360 consoles with no HDD attached), playing an installed copy (either through the installation process or through Games on Demand) causes longer loading times when playing multiplayer.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p><i>Halo Wars </i>is a real-time strategy game set in the <a href=\"/halo/3035-58/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo Universe</a>. It begins in year 2531, twenty years prior to the events of <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, and documents the Covenant eradication of the Outer Colonies during the <a href=\"/human-covenant-war/3015-2708/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2708\">Human-Covenant War</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The game was developed by <a href=\"/ensemble-studios/3010-1360/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1360\">Ensemble Studios</a>, best known for their work on the <a href=\"/age-of-empires/3025-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-22\">Age of Empires series</a>, and is an Xbox 360 exclusive. During the development, Ensemble Studios stayed in contact with <a href=\"/bungie-studios/3010-476/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-476\">Bungie</a>, creators of the Halo <a href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">series</a>, to ensure the game retained the proper look and feel. Some of the specific graphical touches in the game, like getting a scoreboard at the end of each game, the menu system, basic <a href=\"/custom-ui/3015-2554/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2554\">UI</a> and the style of multiplayer lobbies are evocative of other games in the series. Ensemble Studios also took extra care of the game's controls to ensure that the often-complex actions of an RTS are easy to deal with on the Xbox 360 controller.</p><p>Shortly after the release of the game, the news broke that Microsoft Studios was shutting down Ensemble Studios.</p><p>Two downloadable content packs were released for the game by Robot Studios, which handled post release support of the game, until March 2010 when the newly formed <a href=\"/343-industries/3010-6753/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6753\">343 Industries</a> took over all support.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/870134-6876.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870134\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/870134-6876.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870134\"><img alt=\"Bring incredible firepower to bear on your enemies\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/870134-6876.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/19745/870134-6876.jpg 1280w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/870134-6876.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/870134-6876.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Bring incredible firepower to bear on your enemies</figcaption></figure><p>The game's story is told through in-game cut scenes, and in-game moments like games in the series. Halo Wars is set in 2531, giving it the earliest setting of the Halo game series, and focuses on the Marine forces of the <a href=\"/unsc/3015-3859/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC</a> ship CFV-88 <a href=\"/the-spirit-of-fire/3055-1918/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1918\">Spirit of Fire</a> as they engage Covenant ground forces after the discovery of an ancient artifact during a journey to <a href=\"/harvest/3035-338/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-338\">Harvest.</a></p><p>The story begins with the UNSC's early battles on Harvest, but also features another colony world, <a href=\"/arcadia/3035-2452/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2452\">Arcadia</a>, which holds something of great interest to the Covenant. The <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood</a> is significant in the storyline and several massive <a href=\"/the-forerunner/3015-80/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunner</a> structures are also explored.</p><p>Although <a href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-175\">the Master Chief</a> doesn't make any appearance in Halo Wars, several other <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">SPARTAN</a>s do, these are referred to as Red Team. Other key characters in Halo Wars include the A.I. <a href=\"/serina/3005-8610/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8610\">Serina</a>, <a href=\"/ellen-anders/3005-9815/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9815\">Professor Ellen Anders</a>, <a href=\"/john-forge/3005-9816/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9816\">Sergeant John Forge</a> and the Spirit of Fire's commander, <a href=\"/captain-james-gregory-cutter/3005-9817/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9817\">Captain Cutter</a>.</p><h3>Story</h3><p>While Sergeant forge is patrolling the northern regions, Alpha Base is attacked and destroyed by the Covenant, with survivors fleeing to the countryside surrounding the area. Rounding up the survivors, Forge leads them in an assault to remove the covenant presence and re-establish Alpha Base. Forge then leads an attack on a relic site that the Covenant has occupied, eventually removing any remaining Covenant, and making it possible for Anders to examine the relic briefly. The Covenant makes a counter-attack, forcing the UNSC to retreat. However, the information Anders gathered from the relic shows that the Covenant has been pointed to a second UNSC colony, <a href=\"/arcadia/3035-2452/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2452\">Arcadia</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/319/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214121\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56275303643725\" data-width=\"494\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 494px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/319/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214121\"><img alt=\" All Units!\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/319/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/319/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg 494w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/319/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption> All Units!</figcaption></figure><p>Following the Covenant to Arcadia, they find that most of the orbital defence ships have been destroyed or damaged in battle with the Covenant. Forge and his forces are deployed to assist the Spartans from Red Team, in an effort to evacuate the civilians from Arcadia City. After they've evacuated, they withdraw to a safer position while waiting for back-up by Spartan Group Omega. Once the back-up arrives, they move in to find out why the Covenant came to Arcadia. Forge and Anders begin to study the area, but suddenly <a href=\"/ripa-moramee/3005-11521/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11521\">the Arbiter</a> arrives, taking Anders prisoner and wounding Forge; Spartans arrive, but too late to save Anders.</p><p>The Arbiter uses Anders to activate the Apex (a Forerunner installation), revealing a fleet of Forerunner warships, which the Covenant plans to incorporate into their existing fleet. However, Anders manages to escape by using her stasis prison as a translocation device. She then links up with Forge and his Marines, who've managed to clear the area of Covenant forces and establish a base of operation on the Shield World. The UNSC removes the FTL Reactor from the Spirit of Fire and moves into the Apex, planning to detonate it - in hope of the chain-reaction will destroy the whole Forerunner installation and fleet. The Arbiter attempts to stop them, but his Honor Guards are killed by Red Team, and Forge himself manages to kill the Arbiter with one of his own <a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">Energy Swords</a>. Forge stays behind to detonate the reactor, <a href=\"/heroic-sacrifice/3015-3530/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3530\">sacrificing himself</a>, while the rest of the UNSC forces activate a portal, to get them out of the blast radius, and evacuates to the Spirit of Fire.</p><p>Since they had to rip out the FTL Reactor, the Spirit of Fire has lost its ability to go faster than light, making the journey home much, much longer than the crew could survive on their limited supplies. The crew therefore enter cryogenic storage. Here, Sergeant John Forge's cryo-tube is closed by Captain Cutter, who briefly nods, while the camera pans down on the words \"Sgt. J. Forge\", acknowledging the sacrifice he made.</p><p>Serina speaks the final words of the game, in the last moment of the credits over the game's logo, saying:</p><blockquote data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"center\"><p>Captain. Wake up. Something has happened.</p></blockquote><p>The ultimate fate of Spirit of Fire is unknown, and unfortunately will continue to remain unknown, as the game's lukewarm sales and the closing of Ensemble Studios make the possibility of a sequel to Halo Wars slim to nil.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Technology Advancement</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205968\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205968\"><img alt=\"Covenant base struck from orbit by Spirit's MAC cannon.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg 1280w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Covenant base struck from orbit by Spirit's MAC cannon.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg 1280w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3484/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Covenant base struck from orbit by Spirit's MAC cannon.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the campaign and while playing skirmishes, the player must advance their technology in order to bring out heavier fire power. When technology is increased, more units, upgrades and buildings becomes available. For instance, infantry squads can receive additional members or stronger weapons. Field Armories or Temples, and their upgrades, can become available when technology is increased.</p><p>How to advance in technology is different from both factions. The UNSC has to build and upgrade reactors, while the Covenant has to advance in Ages by purchasing upgrades at the leader temple.</p><h3>Veterancy Points</h3><p>Veterancy Points, or stars, is a rank-like system that each unit has, they determine a unit's statistics such as attack damage, fire-rate and defense. They are gained after a unit kills an enemy, destroys a structure, blowing up a vehicles or other other combat related situations. They are also gained by upgrading the unit through buildings. A unit can have a maximum of 3 stars.

      "description": "<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>Eschalon is where the Protagonist (i.e <em>you</em>) wakes up with no memory and only a few scribbled notes to guide them down the storyline. These are written by an unnamed person and scattered around the game world. No extra party members are available, so you'll play this game solo. How much of the main story you accomplish, if any, is up to you. The world itself is ample enough keep any prospective hero busy wide sidequests.</p><p>The main storyline is the recovery of an Artifact of great significance, the huge gem called the Crux of Ages, has been taken by an invading army of gobliods. They have also decimated the lands. Getting the Crux back where it belongs and destroying the goblins completes the story, but if you give it back or kill the Chancellor who rightfully owns it is up to you. A few twists and turns come along by way of side quests that can give you valuable experience and items for building yourself up to tackle the main story.</p><p> </p><p>Day and night are important factors in this game. If things are dark outside they are pitch black. It's still possible to move around, but with absolutely no light on the screen it's difficult to find your way. This is especially true in dungeons, which are rarely well lit places to begin with. Spells and Torches can generate light, but spells are not available without training and torches are a limited resource.</p><h2><strong>Combat System</strong></h2><p>Fighting at range, with magic, or up close and personal is a relatively simply affair. You queue up a spell, pick a level to cast that spell, and click on the enemy. The higher level the spell the more mana used. In this way even the first spell you get in the game can still be useful much later on. Ranged combat and fighting with swords is as simple as equipping what you want to attack with and clicking on the enemy you want to use it on.</p><p>The trick to this system is it's turn based. You take a step, they take a step. You make an attack, then they make an attack. Although it can feel fluid when your running around and shooting off spells, everything on the screen only will make actions after you do.</p><h2><strong>Abilities &amp; Skills</strong></h2><p>Every few levels you gain new points to add to your abilities. They start at anywhere from a random number from 7 to 14, and you can increase those original numbers with a set pool of 15 points. Skills work in much the same way. You get a certain number to start with and increase it as you level up.</p><p><em>Strength</em> raises the amount you can lift and the amount of damage you inflict. Also it plays a role in toxic resistances.</p><p><em>Endurance</em> increases your Hit Points and the rate you heal.</p><p><em>Dexterity</em> increases the chance you'll hit something, and the rate you'll avoid being hit by raising your Armor class.</p><p><em>Speed</em> raises your armor class and slightly increases how often your character acts in combat.</p><p><em>Wisdom</em> increases your defense against curses and disease.</p><p><em>Intelligence</em> helps your elemental resistances and to understand exactly what item magical you found.</p><p><em>Perception</em> increases Mana, and increases the rate you regenerate it.</p><p><em>Concentration</em> increases the chance your spells will not fail if you are struck in combat, and increases several skills.</p><p><em>Alchemy</em> lets up make potions. The higher this stat, the better the potions.</p><p><em>Arcane Divination</em> is usually known as Clerical spells. Mainly for protection, buffs, and healing.</p><p><em>Arcane Elemental</em> is usually known as Mage spells. They damage foes with elements, like fire for example.</p><p><em>Meditation</em> increases you mana recovery and your resistance to some harmful magics.</p><p><em>Lore</em> is the skill used to determine if you know what a magical item does, or if you don't.</p><p><em>Light Armor</em> is fairly obvious. It allows you to wear light armor without the penalty and increases your defense in it.</p><p><em>Heavy Armor</em> is also fairly obvious. It allows you to wear heavy armor without the penalty and increases your defense in it.</p><p><em>Shield Armor</em> is the skill for using a shield in one of your hands. The higher it is, the better the bonus.</p><p><em>Survival</em> is the skill that grants you higher resistance for diseases and for toxins. It also helps regenerate your HP while moving.</p><p><em>Dodge</em> lets you dodge attacks. The higher the score here, the better the chance you'll knock them off their guard and get a bonus to hit.</p><p><em>Hide in Shadows</em> is a stealth move that lets you sneak around.</p><p><em>Move Silently</em> is a stealth skill that allows you to move quickly and without gathering the notice of the enemies on screen.</p><p><em>Pick Locks</em> lets you pick locks. You'll need a lock pick, and the higher you have this score the better your chances.</p><p><em>Skullduggery</em> is for disabling traps you see.

Despite his enthusiasm, he has never seen a planet get glassed by the Covenant (unlike the rest of his squad).

The game sets the players in a partially open city with the goal of finding and investigating the last known locations of your four ODST squad-mates while fighting off the Covenant forces in the area. Once you reach one of the last-known waypoints of a teammate, you discover an object related to the events they've been through--such as a ruined <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle</a> hanging from a street light--and enter a flashback to earlier that day, where you control the squad member for an entire level. Through these 30-minute or so flashbacks (which play more like traditional, linear, Halo levels) you discover the fate of your teammate and unravel the mystery of the events that occurred in New Mombasa. The New Mombasa \" <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world</a>\" is comparable in function to the <a href=\"/hub-world/3015-1855/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\">hub world</a> from a platformer. Although the city in Halo 3: ODST is fairly large, its design and structure is not to be compared with that of <a href=\"/liberty-city/3035-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City</a> from <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto</a> or other traditional sandbox-style <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world games</a>, given that there is no purpose to the hub world other than the story missions. The impact the city's look has and the time difference between flashback sequences and the Rookie's seemingly hopeless current situation are big parts of the game. Because the Rookie is shorter than the <a href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-175\">Master Chief</a>'s towering 7' height, all enemies and vehicles seem slightly larger. The <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">heads-up display</a> is different from previous games since the player views the world from inside a standard-issue ODST helmet instead of a suit of <a href=\"../../mjolnir-armor/93-33/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mjolnir armor</a> or a <a href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Sangheili</a> war harness.</p><p>In addition to the new progression method, players have some new tools at their fingertips:</p><ul><li>A silenced <a href=\"/m7-smg/3055-126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-126\">M7 SMG</a> and a silenced <a href=\"/m6c-magnum/3055-2807/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\">magnum pistol</a>, allowing them to move about the city surreptitiously. Both of these weapon variants have distance scopes, though as they don't do any additional damage, and dual-wielding has been removed, they are significantly less useful than their counterparts from Halo 3.</li><li>VISr Mode, a kind of night vision that outlines friendlies, hostiles, and points-of-interest in glowing neon.</li><li>A PDA, which can provide them a 3D map of the city at all times, and allows them to set personal waypoints.</li></ul><p>However, with the switch to a non-Spartan protagonist, some of the player's abilities are lessened:</p><ul><li>ODSTs do not have a <a href=\"/motion-tracker/3055-2737/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2737\">motion tracker</a>.</li><li>ODSTs use \"stamina\" rather than shields and must use <a href=\"/first-aid-kit/3055-1285/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1285\">medkits</a> to heal their injuries, a la <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.</li><li>ODSTs are slower, shorter, and less agile than the Master Chief, and their melee attacks do substantially less damage.</li><li>ODSTs cannot <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual-wield</a> weapons.</li><li>ODSTs can't throw <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades</a> as far as Spartans or Elites.</li></ul><h2>Firefight</h2><p>Firefight is a <a href=\"/survival-mode/3015-3567/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3567\">survival mode</a> that resembles the <a href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">Horde</a> mode in <a href=\"/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20662\">Gears of War 2</a>.</p><p>There are a total of 10 maps in which a maximum of four players can defend against waves of enemies. Each wave gets progressively harder, players killed will <a href=\"/respawn/3015-989/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-989\">respawn</a> at the end of each wave provided at least one player remains alive. The game continues until all players are dead and the game is over.</p><p><b>The Maps</b></p><ul><li>Crater</li><li>Lost Platoon</li><li>Rally Point</li><li>Security Zone</li><li>Alpha Site</li><li>Windward</li><li>Chasm Ten</li><li>Last Exit</li><li>Crater (Night)</li><li>Rally (Night)</li></ul><p>Firefight mode utilizes the unlockable skulls found in Halo 3, so they do not need to be unlocked in ODST. As you move through the waves of a Firefight match, more skulls will automatically turn on.</p><p>Firefight mode does not feature a matchmaking option for online play, meaning players can only play via system link or online via friend lists.</p><h2>Avatar Awards</h2><p>Halo 3: ODST has several avatar awards you can obtain. Technically, none of the awards are from ODST, they are awarded by <a href=\"/halo-waypoint/3015-3600/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3600\">Halo Waypoint</a>.

Players control the customizable <a href=\"/spartan-312/3005-13970/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13970\">SPARTAN-312</a>, also known as \"Noble Six\", in an elite team of <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">SPARTAN-II and SPARTAN-III</a> super-soldiers known as <a href=\"/noble-team/3015-5853/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5853\">Noble Team</a>. It is the last game in the series to be developed by <a href=\"/bungie/3010-476/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-476\">Bungie</a>, as future development went to <a href=\"/343-industries/3010-6753/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6753\">343 Industries</a>.</p><p>The game brought various additions and changes to Halo 3's gameplay mechanics. Some aspects were returned to their Halo: Combat Evolved roots (namely the removal of <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual-wielding</a> and the return of the health/shield system). The deploayable equipment system was replaced with unique rechargable \"Armor Abilities\" and players can now perform a unique <a href=\"/execution/3015-1546/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1546\">assassination</a> animation. Armor customization options have been revamped, adding more customization options and allowing players to purchase new armor sets with \"credits\" (cR, earned through playing the game). New features include gametype-specific <a href=\"/weapon-slot-loadout/3015-2629/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2629\">loadouts</a>, distinct gameplay differences when playing as <a href=\"/covenant-elite/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites</a>, and <a href=\"/space-battle/3015-4637/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4637\">space combat</a> (in the Campaign only). A revamped version of <a href=\"/horde-mode/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">Firefight</a> mode from <a href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST</a> was also included.</p><p>The game received a multiplayer beta that was accessible through copies of <a href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST</a>. It ran from May 3, 2010 to May 20, 2010 and included four maps (Boneyard, Overlook, Powerhouse, and Sword Base) and a variety of new and existing gametypes.</p><p>A special variation of the game was included as the Multiplayer component in <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</a>. This version only includes Multiplayer with a limited number of maps (six maps, all of which are remakes of maps from previous games) and Firefight with one new map.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Halo: Reach remains very close in style to its predecessors in terms of movement and aiming. The combination of <a href=\"/regenerating-health/3015-83/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-83\">regenerating health</a> (in which health regenerates up to the nearest third) and <a href=\"/shield-regeneration/3015-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">regenerating shields</a> returns from <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, requiring players to pick up <a href=\"/health-pack/3055-255/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-255\">health packs</a> when needed. Unlike the previous Halo games, shields now must be fully depleted in order for players to take health damage (though certain attacks negate it). The ability to <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual wield</a> weapons has been removed altogether (though A.I. Elites sometimes akimbo Plasma Rifles).</p><h3>Armor Abilities</h3><p>New to Halo: Reach is the concept of Armor Abilities, which grant skills that can be activated by pressing a certain button (left bumper by default). This is a general replacement of equipment from Halo 3, though the Bubble Shield returns as the Drop Shield active ability.</p><p>In Campaign levels, the player starts with the Sprint ability, and can only replace it by finding armor abilities throughout the level. In all other modes, the player's armor ability is determined by which loadout they use (which is determined by the game mode itself). Each armor ability have different <a href=\"/cooldowns/3015-2589/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2589\">cooldown</a> timers that prevent the player from using the ability until it has recharged fully or to a specific percentage.</p><ul><li><b>Sprint</b> - Causes players to run faster for a short period of time. However, this lowers their weapon, preventing them from firing from the hip.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Evade</b> - Causes players to perform a quick roll that breaks lock-on from certain weapons.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Armor Lock</b> - Causes players to become completely invulnerable (at the cost of being immovable and unable to fire weapons). Enemies close to the player have their shields removed from the <a href=\"/electromagnetic-pulse/3015-4910/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4910\">EMP</a> burst.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Jet Pack</b> - Propels player into the air (until it runs out of fuel/needs to recharge).</li></ul><ul><li><b>Active Camo</b> - Makes the player nearly invisible. However, the faster they move, the more visible they are. Active Camo also disrupts enemy radar (along with the player's radar) with extra random blips. Audio becomes muffled as well.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Hologram</b> - Creates a hologram of the player which can be used to distract enemies. The hologram walks wherever the player has their reticle pointed at and disappears after being fired upon too much (or after a certain amount of time).</li></ul><ul><li><b>Drop Shield</b> - Creates a blue-tinted bubble shield around the player's location, blocking all weapon fire. The shield also heals the player and all teammates inside, and can be destroyed by taking too much damage.</li></ul><h3>Loadouts</h3><p>Loadouts in multiplayer and Firefight modes determine which armor ability, weapons, and grenades the player can start with. They can be switched during the respawn window or during the start of the match. Loadouts cannot be customized for matchmaking, as they are restricted into each gametype. Players can only choose from up to five loadouts at a time. In Invasion gametypes, Spartans and Elites can have their own loadout selection, which change according to how far the game has progressed.</p><h3>Playable Elites</h3><p>Unlike Halo 2 and Halo 3, in which picking an Elite is a pure aesthetic choice, playable Elites in Halo: Reach are now faster, stronger, and bigger than Spartans. They do not need to use health packs, as their health fully regenerates. Because of these differences, Elites are only playable in Elite Slayer or Invasion (in the Elite team).</p><h3>Assassination</h3><p>New to Halo: Reach, holding down the melee button when attacking someone from behind triggers a third-person animation, depicting the player silently killing the enemy with a knife or plasma sword, depending on their species. Neither player is invulnerable during this animation, and quick players can either rescue those who are being assassinated or steal the kill by killing the player being assassinated. A assassination can change or not even happen if the player isn't looking at the right angle.</p><h3>Weapon Reticles</h3><p>All weapons in Halo: Reach are now subject to reticle bloom. The reticle now gets larger as a weapon is repeatedly fired, showing their worsened accuracy. In order to maintain consistent accuracy, players must wait for the reticle to return to normal size after a short delay. Crouching reduces this bloom. Certain weapons also have a \" <a href=\"/ghost-reticle/3015-5102/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5102\">ghost reticle</a>\", which assists players by showing how far ahead the player needs to aim to hit a target.</p><h3>Space Combat</h3><p>New to Halo: Reach is the concept of space combat. In two sections of \"Long Night of Solace\", players pilot a YSS-1000 space craft (known as a Sabre), fighting Banshees, Seraphs, and Phantoms before disabling a Corvette. The Sabre is very mobile, similar to the Banshee, and have both regenerating health and shields. Players can choose between a machine gun cannon and homing missile launchers.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>UNSC Weapons</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/designated-marksman-rifle/3055-3531/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3531\">Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR)</a></b> - A mid to long ranged single shot rifle. It takes 5 shots to kill a fully-shielded Spartan and 6 shots to kill an Elite. Essentially a superior version of the old Battle Rifle.</li><li><b><a href=\"/m6c-magnum/3055-2807/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\">M6C Magnum</a></b> - Like its Halo: CE counter part it can be very lethal. Takes 5 shots to kill a spartan and 6 to kill an elite. This is a mid to close range weapon. It has a higher rate of fire than the DMR but it is less accurate and more subject to reticle bloom.</li><li><b><a href=\"/ma5c-assault-rifle/3055-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-116\">MA5C Assault Rifle</a></b> - Very similar to the model in Halo 3, except that it now has weapon bloom, and short bursts are more accurate at long range.</li><li><b><a href=\"/m41-rocket-launcher/3055-134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\">M41 Rocket Launcher</a></b> - Similar to Halo 3, yet the vehicle targeting from Halo 2 is back (only against ground vehicles). Also immune to shield pop.</li><li><b><a href=\"/\">M45 Tactical Shotgun</a></b> - Farther reach than the shotguns in previous Halo games as not all shots stay within the reticle, immune to the requirement of a shield pop at close range.</li><li><a href=\"/m319-grenade-launcher/3055-3657/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3657\"><b>M319 Grenade Launcher</b></a> - If it hits its target it explodes. If it does not it bounces around like a frag for a short delay, then explodes. If the trigger is held down after firing it will act as a remote detonation and explode when the trigger is released. The grenade also lets out a small EMP blast disabling jet packs, vehicles and the such.</li><li><a href=\"/srs99d-sniper-rifle/3055-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-113\"><b>SRS99D Sniper Rifle</b></a> - Appears the same as Halo 3, now has a weapon bloom effect that appears to be primarily as an indicator of when the next shot can be fired. Immune to the shield pop requirement.</li><li><a href=\"/h-165-fom-target-locator/3055-5316/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5316\"><b>H-165 FOM (Target Locator)</b></a> - After a charge time and orbital bombardment comes from the sky and destroys anything in its radius. Can be used to paint either a wide area or individual targets. Only available in Campaign or Firefight modes.</li></ul><h3>Covenant Weapons</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/plasma-repeater/3055-3543/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3543\"><b>Plasma Repeater</b></a> - The Covenant version of the assault rifle. It sends out a steady stream of plasma. Fire rate slows as it heats up but never overheats, as fire rate slows, accuracy increases. Pressing the reload button will cool it down and bring it back up to speed. Able to be partially cooled, and cooling can occur during melees and grenade throws.</li><li><a href=\"/plasma-launcher/3055-3603/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3603\"><b>Plasma Launcher</b></a> - It fires off 1 to 4 rounds of plasma bombs depending on how long the trigger is held: The plasma will lock on to both people and vehicles with a similar lock on as a needler. The shots stick to people and vehicles like plasma grenades.</li><li><b><a href=\"/focus-rifle/3055-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3544\">Focus Rifle</a></b> - If the beam rifle and the sentinel beam had a baby this would be it. It a zoomable laser that drains health and shields very quickly. At the current build, it takes about 1.5 seconds to kill a target.</li><li><a href=\"/needle-rifle/3055-3545/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3545\"><b>Needle Rifle</b></a> - Covenant equivalent to the DMR. Fires very long needles, if three needles stick to an unshielded opponent, a super-combine explosion occurs like the needler, it is a one-shot <a href=\"/\">headshot</a> kill on an unshielded opponent as well. It is less inaccurate than the DMR when fired quickly, but does less damage with each individual shot.</li><li><a href=\"/plasma-pistol/3055-119/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-119\"><b>Plasma Pistol</b></a> - Now carries an <a href=\"/\">area of effect</a> component that allows the charged shot to hit multiple targets. It takes from 7 to 10 shots to kill a fully shielded Spartan player.</li><li><a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\"><b>Needler</b></a> - Improved tracking compared to it's Halo 3 version. Also features the \"ghost reticle\" effect. Shields must be down before a super combine will occur.</li><li><a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\"><b>Energy Sword</b></a> - Similar to Halo 3, but it can now be countered by a normal melee strike.</li><li><a href=\"/concussion-rifle/3055-4485/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4485\"><b>Concussion Rifle</b></a> - An Elite equivalent of the <a href=\"/brute-shot/3055-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-123\">Brute Shot</a>, fires a large ball of plasma that explodes on impact.</li><li><a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\"><b>Plasma Rifle</b></a> - The iconic Covenant weapon from all of the past Halo games returns in Reach.</li><li><a href=\"/gravity-hammer/3055-128/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-128\"><b>Gravity Hammer</b></a> - No changes from Halo 3.</li><li><a href=\"/brute-spike-rifle/3055-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-139\"><b>Brute Spike Rifle (Spiker)</b></a> - A returning weapon from Halo 3. No noticeable changes made. It is good in close range for taking down shields, though short, controlled bursts are recommended for medium to long range. Its projectiles have a slight arc, so players should aim higher when firing at longer ranged targets.</li><li><a href=\"/fuel-rod-cannon/3055-923/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-923\"><b>Fuel Rod Cannon</b></a> - Covenant equivalent to the rocket launcher. Fires 5 rounds before needing reloading. Its shots are capable of bouncing off of surfaces.</li></ul><h2>Vehicles</h2><h3>UNSC Vehicles</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/\"><b>Warthog</b></a>: Classic Halo vehicle, mostly used for offensive maneuvers. It can carry one driver, a gunner and a passenger. It's armed with either a M41 12.7mm LAAG <a href=\"/chaingun/3055-3355/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3355\">chain gun</a>, a M68 25mm ALIM canon, or finally a M79 65mm MLRS rocket launcher. The chain gun now overheats after extensive use and has a speed reduction of 25 km/h.</li><li><a href=\"/\"><b>Scorpion</b></a>: A tank that makes up in power what it lacks in speed. It disposes of a M512 90mm canon as well as M257 7.62mm secondary gun turret.</li><li><b><a href=\"/uh-144-falcon/3055-3675/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3675\">Falcon</a>:</b> The UH-144 is a versatile, transverse-rotor multipurpose utility helicopter. Two Falcons can transport a fully-equipped infantry squad faster than any previous system, and provide overwhelming support fire, in most weather conditions.</li><li><a href=\"/\"><b>Mongoose</b></a>: The high speed, light weight troop transport returns. With Forge, players can now change the base color of the Mongoose depending on which team color it spawns with.</li><li><a href=\"/pelican/3055-1038/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1038\"><strong>Pelican</strong></a>: Transports more soldiers than a Falcon (10 instead of 3) and has room for a vehicle. This bird doesn't have any sort of weapons.</li><li><a href=\"/sabre/3055-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4552\"><strong>Sabre</strong></a>: A Space superiority fighter, it transports both a pilot and a radar expert and uses a heavy cannon and Medusa missiles.</li><li><b>Longsword:</b> The previous generation of space superiority fighter, can also serve as a bomber while in atmosphere.</li></ul><h3>Covenant Vehicles</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/ghost/3055-371/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-371\">Ghost</a></b>: Minor aesthetic revisions, but otherwise unchanged from Halo 3. Still equipped with 2 plasma canons with little protection for the pilot.</li><li><a href=\"/wraith/3055-531/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-531\"><b>Wraith</b></a>: No changes from Halo 3. Fires plasma mortars and has a plasma canon. Its weakness is its backside.</li><li><b><a href=\"/banshee/3055-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee</a></b>: Aesthetic overhaul, otherwise unchanged from Halo 3. A new Banshee, the space Banshee, can now go in space.</li><li><b>Spirit:</b> The original Covenant dropship. It is capable of carrying up to 30 infantry and 2 vehicles. It is armed with one heavy plasma auto-cannon.</li><li><b>Revenant:</b> A cross between the Ghost and a Wraith and about the size of a Warthog, this pink beast is fast and furious with mobile plasma artillery. A second seat is available, though there isn't anything for the passenger to do. Like the Ghost, the crew has very little protection.</li><li><strong>Seraph</strong>: A Covenant space superiority fighter that has great handling as well as powerful shields. It's armed with 2 heavy plasma cannons.</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1344675\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1344675\"><img alt=\"A fight between a Spartan and an Elite online\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1344675-reach_mpbeta_boneyardinvasion6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A fight between a Spartan and an Elite online</figcaption></figure><p>Bungie has gone to great lengths to continue the evolution of the multiplayer gameplay expected from a Halo game. That evolution involves many of the changes detailed above. Halo: Reach multiplayer contains <a href=\"/mjolnir-armor/3055-33/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-33\">Armor Abilities</a> that modify the Spartan or Elite armor allowing for different style of play from each player. Additionally, Reach brings back the idea of Halo 2's Y menu with the addition of Active Rosters. Most multiplayer maps were actually designed and then placed into campaign. Elites return to multiplayer with very different characteristics. Most noticeably, Elites are significantly bigger than Spartans - for example, in a crouched position, they are nearly as tall as a standing Spartan. In addition, Elites default run speed is almost as fast as a Spartan using the Sprint Armor Ability. Further differences from previous Halo games MP include, Spartan non-regenerative health, Elite regenerative health, and species specific Armor Abilities and Loadouts. Despite pre-release rumors, multiplayer is not strictly class based, however, the addition of Loadouts, granting players the ability to choose what Armor Ability and weapons they can start the match and re-spawn with, makes it very close to a class based system.</p><h3>Maps</h3><p>The game includes 14 maps from the start (6 of which are built on Forge World, which has no standard map), with 11 maps added later as downloadable packs for a total of 25 maps.</p><p>In addition, players can use Forge to alter map geometry and weapon layouts (sometimes creating brand new arenas).</p><h4>Standard Maps</h4><ul><li><strong>Boardwalk</strong> - A long map used in almost all matchmaking playlists for various gametypes.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Boneyard</strong> - The map is specifically designed for the new Invasion gametype, which is speculated to be a 6v6 variant featuring one team of Spartans against one team of Elites. It is a large map that allows for areas to be progressively opened as the match progresses. The map is set around the construction yard of a UNSC space frigate.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Countdown -</b> This symmetrical map is set in a UNSC base and features a shotgun, Concussion Rifle, and Energy Sword.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Powerhouse</strong> - A former hydroelectric station that has since been put to use by the UNSC military. Powerhouse is designed to support small-team games, such as Slayer. The default map variant features plenty of weapon variety. There are several DMRs, Magnums, Plasma Pistols, Needlers, and Needle Rifles scattered about the map. There are also some important power weapons available: a Gravity Hammer, a Focus Rifle, and a Rocket Launcher.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Reflection</b> - Remake of \"Ivory Tower\" from Halo 2.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Spire</b> - The game on Spire relies heavily on air combat. It has 16 player Invasion.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Swordbase</b> - With a design inspired by a pair of fan favorite maps from Halo: Combat Evolved, Prisoner and Boarding Action, this map is small and asymmetrical -- perfectly-suited for Slayer and one-sided Objective matches. There are three power weapons available for players to fight over: an Energy Sword, a Plasma Launcher, and a Sniper Rifle.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Zealot</b> - A Covenant themed map drawing map/aesthetic design cues from Midship, though is significantly different in layout.

To prevent that problem from happening in Reach Bungie has replaced ranked matches with a new playlist - the Arena.</p><p>The Arena is broken up into month long seasons. Each season players can place within one of 5 divisions. The divisions are Onyx, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. The players division rank for each season will stay with their gaming history. In interviews Bungie has compared players divisional placement history to the stats on the back of a baseball card. This provides an incentive to stay with one account so not to lose that history. Moreover, divisional assignments are made rather quickly, so a high level player will be playing other high level players within just a few days of the start of a new season.</p><p>To place in a division players will have to play a minimum number of matches over a minimum number of days. Players need to complete 3 Arena matches in a day in order to receive a Daily Ranking. The player is assigned to a division after receiving 3 daily rankings.</p><p>The players daily ranking will be based on the three best matches they played during that day. And the seasonal ranking will be based on the players three best daily rankings throughout the month. Therefore, once the divisional assignment is complete, the player can only climb in the rankings. Once the divisional assignment is made no amount of bad play can lower ranking, but a day or two of great play can increase it.</p><p>The players ranking for each match will be based on how well they play as a member of a team. No longer will assists and K/D ratios be discounted in favor of pure kills. A player with 0 kills, 5 assists and 5 deaths will receive a higher ranking than the player who got 20 kills, no assists, and 20 deaths. Being on a winning team still matters, but now if the player is the only one on the losing team that went positive, they’ll be rewarded and may even get a higher rating than some under performing members of the winning team.</p><h3>Forge 2.0</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1447806\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1447806\"><img alt=\"Welcome to Forge World\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg 1280w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Welcome to Forge World\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg 1280w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Welcome to Forge World</figcaption></figure><p>Forge has seen significant changes from the forge mode in Halo 3. The mode remains purely an object editor without terrain editing. However, the built-in structures allow one to create much more complicated levels than Halo 3's Sandbox or Foundry. The most important new feature is the ability to change an objects physical property from normal (object is affected by gravity like Halo 3), fixed (object is not affected by gravity), and phased (object now has no collision detection and can be pushed through walls and other objects). Each piece has further useful settings such as increasing the effective radius and shape of a teleporter or changing the color of the object to match team specifications. Several of maps that come on disc are direct remakes of older Halo maps, and each shows the variety of maps that can be produced in the new Forge.</p><h3>Multiplayer Matchmaking</h3><ul><li>Arena - A set of playlists, such as Free-for-All and Team Slayer that are similar to the Ranked Playlists of the Halo 3. The Arena uses a new rating system that counts other factors than wins to rank the player in 5 divisions in month long seasons. Players can move up or down in the season divisions, and play players in their division. They are then ranked in their division, and to qualify for a \"daily ranking\" players can also play a certain number of matches in a day.</li></ul><ul><li>Active Roster - Active Roster takes much of the information that was in the Halo 3 players' profiles under \"Halo 3 Party\" and puts it on the main menus. This tells the player his/her friends' current parties, games being played in, score and remaining time.</li><li>Queue Joining - Allows the player to wait in a lobby for a friend, rather than wait for a match to end to join a friend, as in Halo 3, or actually join the match, as in Modern Warfare 2.</li><li>Veto 2.0 - Gives the players three maps and gametypes to choose from in the lobby for the players to vote on.</li></ul><ul><li>New Party-Up System - After a match, all players are kept in a lobby to move into the next match together, rather than looking for new players every time. There is an opt-out to still go into a brand new lobby.</li><li>New Preferences System - The game now has a preferences system for Chattiness, Motivation, Teamwork, and Tone</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer Gametypes</h2><p>Halo: Reach has 12 multiplayer gametypes and one gametype specifically made for Forge, each customizable in many ways. Some official Bungie gametypes are not built-in to the game and must be downloaded from either a search or by playing that gametype in Matchmaking. The VIP gametype from Halo 3 has been removed, as well as most gametype variations from previous Halo games.</p><p>By default, players start with the Assault Rifle and Magnum and have five loadouts: Sprint, Armor Lock, Active Camo, Hologram, and Drop Shield.</p><h3>Slayer</h3><p>Originated in <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/87790/3088406-icon_slayer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3088406\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/87790/3088406-icon_slayer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3088406\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/3088406-icon_slayer.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/3088406-icon_slayer.png 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/3088406-icon_slayer.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/3088406-icon_slayer.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Standard <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch</a> in free-for-all or team scenarios.</p><p>In default variations, players/teams earn points by successfully killing enemies and lose points by killing themselves (or teammates).</p><p>Options that can be changed include:</p><ul><li>Adding special traits to the player who has the most kills at the time (the Leader).</li></ul><ul><li>Changing the scoring system.

The core concept remains the same, that being a set number of players fight against waves of AI enemies with increased difficulty through difficulty modifiers. The additions to Reach come in the form of improved matchmaking and network support, instead of the invite only nature of ODST. Furthermore, Firefight has been given a overhaul in terms of customization, allowing the user to tweak the mode to their liking. The player can change a multitude of options such as the weapon drops, types of enemies, the way in the which the enemies behave, and much more. The addition of new types of objective-based gametypes inside of Firefight adds more variety as well, such as the Generator Defense gametype (seen in the multiplayer beta) asks the players to defend a number of generators against Covenant forces.</p><p>There is also the newly announced Versus Firefight which is a 2v2 gametype. 2 players are Spartans and there goal is to score as many points as possible in the allotted time frame, with a set number of lives. The other 2 players plays as Elites with Covenant reinforcements being dropped off just like regular Firefight, the Elite players' job is to kill the Spartans as fast as possible. The Elites score no points and have infinite lives to kill the Spartans, however the Spartans gain an extra life and point boost every time they kill one of the Elite's. When the round ends team switch sides and whoever scores the most points wins the game.</p><h3>Firefight Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Beachhead</b> - Set in a natural park in the metropolitan city of New Alexandria, on the planet Reach.</li><li><b>Corvette -</b> Set inside a Covenant cruiser in orbit above Reach, the combat on the map is focused inside a hangar bay.</li><li><b>Courtyard</b> - Wage war in a Courtyard outside an ONI building on Reach.

The Spartan that the player creates is used for Single player/ Co-Op Campaign, Firefight and Matchmaking.</p><h2>Persistent Stats</h2><p>Halo: Reach improves upon the persistent experience of Halo 3.</p><h3>Experience System</h3><p>The experience system used in Halo: Reach uses \"Credits\" (abbreviated to cR), which can be earned in a variety of ways in all game modes (after finishing the match):</p><ul><li><b>Game Completion</b> - Completing the match (or exiting out of a non-matchmaking match) earns all players the same amount of cR. (Which varies according to game mode and match duration)</li><li><b>Commendations</b> - Commendations are given by earning medals (given under special circumstances) in the match. Players also earn cR through special awards (known formally as Commendations) that are tracked among all games the player has played on that mode (Campaign, Multiplayer Matchmaking, and Firefight Matchmaking).</li><li><b>Challenges</b> - Each day brings four new Daily Challenges, which gives players a specific task to perform (such as completing a Campaign level on a certain difficulty with certain skulls on or killing a certain number of players in Matchmaking). Each week also brings one Weekly Challenge, which gives a harder, more demanding challenge.</li><li><b>Slot Machine</b> - Matchmaking only. A random bonus is given to each player, usually around 100 cR.</li></ul><h3>Credits</h3><p>Players are ranked according to how much \"Credits\" they collect throughout their entire Halo: Reach career. Buying things from the Armory does not reduce the player's amount of experience or rank. Once players reach certain ranks, more gear is unlocked (or uncovered) in the Armory.</p><h3>Commendations</h3><p>Commendations are special awards that players earn throughout their Halo: Reach career. Performing certain actions multiple times increase their Commendation's level. When the level gauge is filled, their Commendations upgrade and the player receives cR. The Commendations list in each player's service record is sorted by the most upgraded Commendation. There are six milestones in each Commendation, each with their own emblem. (Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Onyx, and maximum Onyx) There is a total of 45 Commendations, split into three different categories: Campaign (green Commendations), Multiplayer Matchmaking (blue Commendations), and Firefight Matchmaking (red Commendations).</p><ul><li><b>Cannon Fodder (Campaign) / Target Practice (Firefight)</b> - Kill an Infantry-class enemy.</li><li><b>Close Quarters (Multiplayer)</b> - Kill an enemy in close-quarters combat (Melee, Shotgun, Energy Sword, Gravity Hammer).</li><li><b>Demon (Campaign)</b> - Complete a Campaign mission.</li><li><b>Downshift (Multiplayer)</b> - Be the driver of a vehicle while a passenger on a mounted weapon kills an enemy.</li><li><b>Flawless Cowboy (Campaign) / Perfectionist (Firefight)</b> - Complete a Campaign mission (on Heroic or Legendary) or a Firefight Matchmaking round without dying.</li><li><b>Jack of All Trades (Multiplayer)</b> - Earn a specific medal. (Such as First Strike, Revenge, and Killjoy)</li><li><b>Leadership Element (Campaign) / In Command (Firefight)</b> - Kill a Leader-class enemy.</li><li><b>Nice Arm (Campaign) / Grenadier (Multiplayer) / Pull the Pin (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with a frag or plasma grenade.</li><li><b>Pinpoint (Campaign) / One Shot (Multiplayer) / Dome Inspector (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with a headshot.</li><li><b>Precisely (Campaign) / Crack Shot (Multiplayer) / Longshot (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with a precision weapon (DMR, Needle Rifle, Focus Rifle, or Sniper Rifle)</li><li><b>Rear Admiral (Multiplayer)</b> - Perform an assassination on an enemy.</li><li><b>Right of Way (Campaign) / Grounded (Firefight)</b> - Blow up an enemy vehicle.</li><li><b>Small Arms (Campaign) / Sidearm (Multiplayer) / Trigger Happy (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with a Magnum or a Plasma Pistol.</li><li><b>SpecOps (Campaign) / Specialized (Firefight)</b> - Kill a Specialist-class enemy.</li><li><b>Splash Damage (Campaign) / Heavy Weapon (Multiplayer) / Get Loud (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with a heavy weapon (Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, Plasma Launcher, Spartan Laser, Concussion Rifle, Fuel Rod Gun, or Target Locator).</li><li><b>Standard Issue (Campaign) / Trigger Man (Multiplayer) / Riflin' Through (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with an automatic weapon (Assault Rifle, Needler, Plasma Rifle, Plasma Repeater, or Spiker).</li><li><b>Super Soldier (Campaign) / Any Spree (Multiplayer) / Methodical (Firefight)</b> - Earn any type of spree, (such as Killing Spree and Wheelman Spree).</li><li><b>Support Role (Campaign) / Assistant (Multiplayer) / Backup (Firefight)</b> - Earn an assist.</li><li><b>Walking Tank (Campaign) / Multikill (Multiplayer) / Numbers Game (Firefight)</b> - Earn a multikill.</li><li><b>War Machine (Campaign) / Mobile Asset (Multiplayer) / Vehicular (Firefight)</b> - Kill an enemy with a vehicle.</li></ul><h3>Nameplates</h3><p>Although nameplate emblems (special icons that appear next to the player's emblem in multiplayer lobbies) have existed since Halo 2, they were only to show that the player is a Bungie.net member or a Bungie employee. While nameplates can still only be changed through a Bungie.net, they can be customized in one of 13 different options:</p><ul><li><b>Blank</b> - Default.</li><li><b>Septagon</b> - Unlocked once the gamertag is linked to a Bungie.net account.</li><li><b>DMR</b> - Unlocked by subscribing to the Bungie Pro service.</li><li><b>Marathon</b> - Unlocked by playing the full version of the Xbox Live

      "description": "<p> Night of the  Cephalopods is a survival horror game inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, featuring charming pixel art graphics  and an innovative fully voiced dynamic narrative system.           <br/> <br/>The main character starts the game lost and confused in a large overgrown graveyard, after accidentally summoning legions of tentacled monsters through reding the dreaded <i>Octonomicon</i>. With your trusty shotgun and precious few shells you must fight to survive until dawn breaks. <br/> <br/>The game's dynamic narration consists of a high quality voice-over commenting on your actions and the environments you explore. Written and performed in a very Lovecraftian style, this innovative game mechanic expands both the mood and atmosphere of the game.  The developers sought to expand upon the concept of a <i>player created narrative</i> that would work as an alternative for cutscenes and other concepts that distance the players actions from the narrative.<br/><br/>Night of the Cephalopods was originally created during the (then) Toronto-based <i>Artsy Games Incubator</i> event.</p>",

Set 32 years prior to the game, the story follows Officer Cadet <a href=\"/thomas-lasky/3005-24200/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24200\">Thomas Lasky</a> (who plays an important support character in the game) as he struggles through the Corbulo military academy only to help Master Chief defend the academy against the Covenant.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game was later ported to the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> by <a href=\"/ruffian-games/3010-6557/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6557\">Ruffian</a> on November 11, 2014 in the <a href=\"/halo-the-master-chief-collection/3030-46552/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46552\">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> compilation. Including all DLC and slight graphics upgrades, the compilation links previous games together through a single game interface (allowing full matchmaking and custom lobby access without the need to switch between different games manually).</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Prologue</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game opens with a conversation between <a href=\"/dr-catherine-halsey/3005-16267/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16267\">Dr. Catherine Halsey</a>, creator of the <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">Spartan</a>-IIs, and a <a href=\"/united-nations-space-command/3015-3859/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC</a> official. The official makes various arguments as to the Spartan-II program having been unethical, including the facts that the program involved the kidnapping of children, that the Spartan-IIs were originally developed to stop human rebellion, and that the Spartan-IIs have shown sociopathic tendencies. Halsey justifies the program by stating that her work saved humanity from the <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">Covenant</a> and works out that she is being interviewed because the UNSC are trying to replace the Master Chief. The scene ends with Halsey telling the official not to underestimate the Spartans and not to underestimate the Master Chief specifically.</p><h3>Forward Unto Dawn</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game then snaps to the wreckage of the derelict starship <a href=\"/unsc-forward-unto-dawn/3055-2812/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2812\">UNSC <i>Forward Unto Dawn</i></a>, in the year 2557 (four years after the events of Halo 3), as it drifts closer to an artificial <a href=\"/the-forerunner/3015-80/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunner</a> planet. Detecting a strange disturbance aboard the ship, Cortana wakes the Chief from cryo-sleep. They then make their way through the ship, finding Covenant are boarding and attacking them, despite a truce being declared four years ago with the <a href=\"/covenant-elite/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites</a>, and experience the ship being scanned by unknown technology. The two soon discover that they are not just in proximity of one Covenant ship, but a whole fleet. The Chief is able to use the weaponry of the <i>Forward Unto Dawn</i> to destroy the Covenant cruiser closest to them, however a gravity well opens on the world which begins to pull the ship in.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana make their way towards the escape pods, although as they do Cortana starts exhibiting bizarre behaviour. As they reach the escape pods, the force of the gravity well begins tearing the <i>Dawn</i> apart and pulls the Chief out into space. After being knocked unconscious by flying wreckage he awakens inside the planet, where Cortana begins acting mentally unhinged. Despite her immediate response that there is nothing wrong with her, the Chief persuades her to tell him that she is in the first stages of a process known as rampancy, in which AI become increasingly mentally unstable and eventually cease functioning altogether. She explains that the average operational lifespan of a UNSC AI is seven years, and that she is now in her eighth year of operation. Although she tells the Chief that she cannot be fixed, he insists that they will find a way back to her creator, Dr. Halsey, so that she may be repaired.</p><h3>Requiem</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief fights his way through more of the Covenant forces, which are composed of the “Storm Covenant”, a hostile splinter group of the religious faction. Cortana also detects a transmission from the starship <a href=\"/unsc-infinity/3055-5701/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5701\">UNSC <i>Infinity</i></a>, which the two attempt to reach the source of. Making it deeper into the planet, they manage to access a computer in an attempt to track the signal, and discover they are inside a Forerunner shield world called <a href=\"/requiem/3035-2921/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2921\">Requiem</a>. The system quickly locks up, but the two are able to bring it back online and Cortana is able to use it to find that the <i>Infinity</i>'s signal appears to be coming from the shield world’s core. They then travel to a point on the other side of the facility to open a portal from which to reach <i>Infinity.</i></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once they reach the destination from which the portal can be opened, Cortana notes that attempting to contact the point in the planet’s systems closest to the core caused them to return the Forerunner glyph for Reclaimers (i.e. Humanity), which the Chief assumes has to indicate that the <i>Infinity</i> must be there. A number of unusual robotic beings then spring up around the two and a portal to the planet’s core seems to spontaneously open. The Chief grabs Cortana’s data chip and runs into the portal.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the two arrive in Requiem’s core, Cortana informs the Chief that the machines they saw were some kind of advanced defence AI, and they discover that while the <i>Infinity</i> is not stationed in the core of the planet, a satellite relaying the signal from <i>Infinity</i> is. However, Cortana also notes that there are two pylons on the planet interfering with the signal which they must disable if they are to contact the <i>Infinity.</i> While working to bring down the pylons Cortana works out that the metallic enemies they are now facing are called “Prometheans” and displays further signs of rampancy. She later discovers that <i>Infinity</i> isn’t inside the planet, but that it is orbiting it, and appears to be responding to the distress beacon from <i>Forward Unto Dawn</i>. Cortana begins repeated attempts to contact the <i>Infinity</i>, trying to ward it away from the planet, so it is not sucked into the gravity well as the <i>Dawn</i> was.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After shutting down the first pylon, the two discover that the Covenant are heading to the second pylon, but the Chief manages to fight through further waves of both the Prometheans and Covenant, and successfully shut down the pylon. Despite the lack of interference, Cortana finds that the transmitter in the Master Chief’s armour is not strong enough to transmit the necessary signal to the <i>Infinity,</i> and so they use the planet’s portal system to reach the satellite in the core, from which they may be able to broadcast a more powerful signal.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After fighting their way to what they believe to be a broadcast system, and attempting to use it to contact they <i>Infinity,</i> they realize too late that they have been deliberately mislead; this is not a communications system, but a prison system, and their actions have accidentally released a Forerunner criminal known as the <a href=\"/the-didact/3005-24550/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24550\">Didact</a>. They discover that he had manipulated <i>Infinity</i>’s signals as a trap to get them to release him, and declares that the Forerunner are returning and that he intends to destroy Humanity, whom the rest of his race had declared their successors, the Reclaimers. He easily knocks the Chief unconscious before taking a ship and escaping in it through a slipspace portal. The Chief wakes up with Cortana telling him that the Didact’s use of slipspace destabilized the core of the planet, and that they must leave it immediately. At this point the <i>Infinity</i> also starts broadcasting an emergency signal indicating that they have been pulled in by Requiem’s gravity well.</p><h3>The <i>Infinity</i></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief escapes the core in a <a href=\"/ghost/3055-371/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-371\">Ghost</a> which he eventually manages to jump through a portal. After arriving on the other side of the portal, he sees the <i>Infinity</i> flying overhead and hears a broadcast from it as the ship prepares to crash land. Cortana and the Chief set a course for the <i>Infinity</i>, seeing the Didact’s ship also going in pursuit of it.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief finds the Didact’s ship near <i>Infinity</i>’s crash site and manages to make brief radio contact with the Infinity before making his way towards the ship. Inside the ship he meets with <a href=\"/thomas-lasky/3005-24200/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24200\">Commander Thomas Lasky</a> and Spartan-IV, <a href=\"/commander-palmer/3005-24205/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24205\">Commander Sarah Palmer</a>. He discovers that the recon team the <i>Infinity</i> sent out after they landed have become stranded, and won’t be able to return to the ship on foot. At this point Lasky asks the Chief to secure the area so that the recon teams may be safely recovered, which he obliges.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As the Chief and Cortana attempt to help recovery of the recon teams, Cortana becomes worried by the increasingly intense signs of rampancy she is showing, despite the Chief’s reassurance. As the Chief successfully secures a landing zone for Pelican-class ships to bring back the stranded soldiers, Lasky sends out a transmission indicating that the Covenant have managed to get into the <i>Infinity</i> and that all soldiers are immediately ordered to return to the ship. The Chief manages to make his way back to <i>Infinity</i> where he meets with <a href=\"/andrew-del-rio/3005-24206/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24206\">Captain Andrew Del Rio</a> who tells him that the Didact has managed to disable the ship’s defences and is extracting data from it is mainframes. The Chief manages to use a Mantis-class mech to fight off the Covenant in the ship, and destroy the jammers that were preventing the ships defences from functioning.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With defences back online the <i>Infinity</i> is able to use its MAC cannons to fire on the Didact’s ship, causing it to retreat. At this point Del Rio orders the ship’s forces to stand down, and the Chief, Cortana, Lasky, and Del Rio come together to assess the situation. Lasky explains that the purpose of the <i>Infinity</i> was to establish bases to study the <a href=\"/halo/3035-58/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo</a> installations for decommission. After excavating a Forerunner artefact part of the <i>Infinity</i> science team were killed, but a series of co-ordinates were recovered that led the <i>Infinity</i> to Requiem. Despite the Chief’s view that it would be an opportune time to attack the Didact while he is vulnerable, Del Rio instead makes it the mission of the <i>Infinity</i> to escape Requiem’s gravity well and file a threat assessment with the UNSC Fleet Command.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Del Rio mobilises the <i>Infinity</i>’s forces, including Chief, Cortana, Palmer, and Lasky, along with a number of vehicles, including a Mammoth-class troop transport, to take down particle cannons within the planet so that they can make their escape. Cortana again displays signs of further rampancy and expresses her worry over the situation, but she and the Chief eventually reach the particle cannon command post where an elevator takes them directly to the co-ordinates provided to them by the <i>Infinity</i>, leading them to think that they are walking into a trap.</p><h3>The Librarian</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Within the facility the two encounter “what remains” of a long-dead Forerunner known as the <a href=\"/the-librarian/3005-24643/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24643\">Librarian</a>. She explains that her memories had been stored within the facility to help Humanity adopt the Forerunner philosophy of \"the Mantle\", but that the Didact threatens that plan and must not be allowed to leave Requiem. She then informs the Chief that the Didact seeks a weapon known as the Composer which can contain the Forerunner’s greatest enemy, humanity.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Librarian details a war fought between humanity and the Forerunners long ago, after humanity were seen doing what they believed to be aggressively expanding their control over the universe. Humanity overcame entire star systems before the Didact rose up and used his warriors to push them back. After a millennium of slaying humanity, the Didact was sentenced to punishment and the Forerunners discovered too late that humanity were not trying to expand, but were rather running from the Flood. Weakened after the war, the Forerunners started to fall easily to the Flood.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Forerunners made plans to use the Halo rings, the Ark, and the shield worlds to save all life in the galaxy, however, the Didact refused to yield to the philosophy of the Mantle and devised his own plan. The Composer was intended to be a tool to make the Forerunners immortal by allowing life to be converted from an organic to a digital form, which would have protected them from the <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood</a>, as the Flood only consume and can survive by consuming organic tissue. However, the Composer could not convert sentient minds properly, and when the Forerunners attempted to return lifeforms to their organic state, it created only what the Librarian describes as “abominations”. The Didact used the Composer to take his revenge on humanity, with the Prometheans being the result of human beings being converted to a digital form. The Didact had intended to convert all of humanity, however, the Composer was forcibly taken from him and he was imprisoned.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When humanity was preserved so that they could repopulate the galaxy after the Forerunners had eradicated the Flood, the Librarian hid the “seeds” of humanity from the Didact. She had done this in part of a plan for the future of humanity, however, before the Librarian can inform the Chief of what this plan is, they are discovered by the Didact. Before the Chief leaves, the Librarian is able to biologically modify him to be impervious to the effects of the Composer.</p><h3>Del Rio</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Regrouping with <i>Infinity</i>’s forces, he and the ship manage to destroy the gravity well. Del Rio, the Chief, Cortana, and Lasky, then meet once again on-deck. After explaining what the Librarian had told him the Chief tells Del Rio that it is imperative to humanity’s safety that the Didact is stopped, however, Del Rio insists that their mission is still to leave Requiem, dismissing the story of the Librarian as a hallucination. After an outburst of rampancy from Cortana Del Rio orders Lasky to confiscate the data chip containing Cortana so that she may be decommissioned (read: executed). The Chief takes the data chip before he can do so, and refuses orders to surrender it to Del Rio, leading him to call Palmer to arrest the Chief. However, she does not comply, and the Chief then leaves with Cortana, instructing Lasky to send word back to Earth.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As Chief prepares his weapons Cortana stares at the Sun outside and laments her inability to actually know if it looks and feels real, eventually turning and telling the Chief to promise that, before their current conflict ends, he will figure out “Which one of us is the machine”. Lasky arrives on deck with orders to prevent the Chief from leaving, but instead provides him a combat-ready Pelican with which to pursue the Didact.</p><h3>Post-<i>Infinity</i></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana find the Didact’s ship with its shields up and Cortana devises a plan to take them down by exploiting two nearby stations which are acting as traffic control for resources flowing to and from the ship. The Chief makes his way inside both of the stations to use them to send an override code into the ship, forcing it’s defences down. The Didact becomes aware of their plan and manages to speak to the Chief directly, despite Cortana being unable to hear him, and uses Promethean and Covenant forces to try and keep them from achieving their objective.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After they successfully drop the ship’s shields, Cortana directs Chief to another tower from which the ship is controlling a number of defence spires, with the plan being that if the Chief turns them against the Didact’s ship, he can be prevented from leaving. The Cortana and Chief make their way to the control room at the top of the tower where Cortana attempts to use the defence spires to lock the Didact’s ship in place, but her rampancy causes her to malfunction and lose control of the spires. With the Didact and his accompanying Covenant about to leave, the Chief takes Cortana and jumps from the tower onto a Covenant Lich-class vessel which he is able to ride on, as it, the other Covenant vessels, and the much larger Forerunner vessel which the Didact’s ship now occupies, leave Requiem via slipspace.</p><h3>Ivanoff Station</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The ships emerge near Halo ring Installation 03 where they attack the nearby UNSC scientific facility that is in possession of the Composer, Ivanoff Station. The Chief enters the Covenant ship he is riding on, managing to kill its occupants, and makes contact with a Sandy Tilson on the station, however, their communication is cut short, and the ship crashes when Cortana once again malfunctions due to rampancy. The Chief wakes up on-board a damaged section of the station with Cortana emotionally unstable and apologising.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief communicates with Tilson again, who explains that they are trying to evacuate the station, but that Covenant have taken control of the landing bay. The Chief is able to secure an evacuation route for the scientists, bring the station’s shields back online, and clear the station of Covenant. Upon reaching Tilson the Chief declares that the Composer needs to be removed from the station, however, Tilson explains that they literally cannot move it. Despite the initial objections of Tilson, he decides that if the Composer cannot be moved then it can be prevented from falling into the Didact’s hands by annihilating it with nuclear weaponry.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana manage to make it to the station’s defence grid controls to bring its defences back online, while the science team prime the nuclear bomb to destroy the Composer. Cortana, who is becoming increasingly rampant, asks the Chief that if she and he should make it back to Dr. Halsey, for him not to tell her how unstable she got, to which the Chief agrees. Before the Chief can meet back up with the science team, the Didact discovers the exact location of the Composer, and the Chief requests that the science team provide him with the nuke, despite it not being ready yet. The Chief manages to fend off Covenant making their way into the area housing the Composer, using a Mantis mech, but before it can be destroyed, the Didact manages to lift the Composer out of the station and into his ship.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief returns to the scientists as the Didact’s ship takes aim on the station. Cortana finds that the station defences will not respond and the Didact manages to use the Composer to kill everyone within the station, apart from Cortana, and the Chief, who is knocked unconscious. When he awakens Cortana appears emotionally disturbed as she explains that she heard the digitized scientists being agonizingly converted into Prometheans. She then begins to speculate about how if she dies the UNSC will try to pair the Chief with another AI, possibly another version of Cortana, and tells the Chief “It won’t be me, you know that, right?”. The Chief tells Cortana that he won’t let her die and assures her that “It’s not over yet”, but it is clear Cortana no longer believes this.</p><h3>The Didact's Ship</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana arm a Broadsword-class fighter with the nuke and fly it off-station, into the Didact’s ship as it flies into slipspace again. As the Chief fights his way across the Didact’s ship in the Broadsword, he stays in contact with UNSC forces, most notably Lasky, aboard the <i>Infinity</i>, who has taken the position of Captain after UNSC Fleet Command objected to Del Rio abandoning a legendary war hero like the Master Chief on Requiem. The Didact’s ship heads towards Earth, and the UNSC's orbital defences prove ineffective in stopping it.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief is eventually able to disable the particle cannons on the ship, allowing the <i>Infinity</i> to punch a hole in the hull which he can fly the Broadsword into. Once inside the ship’s hull, free of the Broadsword, and carrying the nuclear device with him, the Chief inserts Cortana into the ship’s systems, where she is able to manipulate a portal system, similar to the one on Requiem, so that the Chief may reach the Didact. However, when the Didact begins fighting back against Cortana she has difficulties simultaneously fighting him and keeping control over her rampancy.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief is eventually able to reach the room where the Didact and the Composer are housed. Here Cortana begins injecting the mentally instable and continually dividing versions of herself into the Didact’s system, in an effort to bring down his shields as he powers up the Composer. The Chief makes his way around the chamber, manually inserting Cortana into the systems, using her rampancy to sabotage the Didact. Despite the Chief lowering his shields, the Didact is able to fire the Composer on Earth, hitting part of what is currently known as North America.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief reaches the core of the chamber where he crosses a light bridge to arm the nuke and destroy the Composer, but becomes cautious as the Didact no longer appears to be with the Composer, but hidden elsewhere. The Didact appears behind the Chief, encouraging him to fight him, but as he tries to do so the Didact is able to knock the nuke free from him and telepathically paralyse him. However, the rampant copies of Cortana in the ship’s systems manipulate the light bridge to restrain the Didact, and the Chief manages to plant a grenade into his chest, the detonation of which causes the Didact to stumble and fall from the light bridge into the Composer’s beam. The Chief then crawls towards the nuke and detonates it manually.</p><h3>The Ending</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief finds himself without Cortana in a blue translucent sphere in space that appears to have properties similar to a hologram or light-bridge. A physical manifestation of Cortana appears to him, but upon asking on how they can get out of this space, Cortana tells him that she can’t go with him. She explains that most of her was on the Didact’s ship and that she only saved enough of herself outside of that to protect the Chief and take him off the ship. The Chief insists that the two of them leave together, but Cortana informs him that it is impossible. For the first time Cortana physically touches the Chief, something she says she has been waiting a very long time to do, and he implies that he feels as though he failed in his duty to protect her. Cortana tells him that they were meant to take care of each other, and did so successfully. Cortana walks away from the Chief, despite him asking her to wait, and tells him “Welcome home, John” before disappearing entirely. Shortly after, the sphere around the Chief disappears and he begins floating off into space.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A Pelican eventually recovers the Chief who returns to the UNSC <i>Infinity</i>. On-deck in the ship he stares out at the Earth and is joined by Lasky who empathises with him over his loss. The Chief tells Lasky that as soldiers it is their duty to protect humanity, whatever the cost, to which Lasky responds that humanity and soldiers are not different things, and that soldiers are people, not machines. Lasky leaves the deck as the Chief remembers Cortana’s earlier suggestion that he may be more like a machine than a person. The game then cuts to a closing message from 343 Industries, declaring that this is the start of a new journey with Halo, and that they thank their fans for joining them and trusting them with the Halo universe.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game’s epilogue features UNSC soldiers exploring the city of New Phoenix, where the Composer’s beam hit and left cities standing, but people entirely eradicated. Played over this is a speech by the Didact, apparently made millions of years ago, when he was defending himself against the crimes that got him locked up on Requiem in the first place. He speaks of the Forerunner defeat and how important they are to the universe. The game then cuts to the Chief, who is walking along a long corridor in the <i>Infinity</i>, as the Didact declares that he has been accused of the sin of 'preventing the Forerunners taking a less prominent role in the universe as other forces become more powerful.' As the game cuts to a scene of John having his armor removed, the Didact claims that Humanity is the greatest threat to the universe, that they must be stopped by the Forerunners, and that they have unfairly begun the process of 'Reclamation'. The last shot of the game is the Master Chief’s helmet being removed, wiping to black. The Legendary ending replaces the wipe with a brief glimpse of John's eyes; his full face is not seen.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Weapons</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Halo 4 includes a variety of new weaponry for players, including human weapons used by the UNSC (including the <a href=\"/m363-remote-projectile-detonator/3055-5702/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5702\">M363 Sticky Detonator</a>, Carbine-920 Railgun, and M739 SAW), and Forerunner weapons used by the Promethean A.I. (including the Z-110 Boltshot, Z-130 Suppressor, Z-180 Scattershot, Z-250 Light Rifle, Z-390 Incineration Cannon, and Z-750 Binary Rifle). Other weapons also make a minor upgrade (mostly for cosmetic purposes), including the BR85GB SR Battle Rifle (replacing the BR55HB SR Battle Rifle).

Each beam must be charged fully (which takes roughly 2-3 seconds), in which the weapon emits a loud sound and shines a red targeting laser. It cannot be replenished by picking up ammo (and must be dropped after being depleted) and fires up to four shots. Formally known as the \"M6 Grindell/Galilean Nonlinear Rifle\".</li><li><a href=\"/m41-rocket-launcher/3055-134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\"><b>Rocket Launcher</b></a> - A powerful <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launcher</a> with a scope attachment (supporting 2x magnification).

The grenade is remotely-detonated (also with the fire button, meaning that only one grenade could be fired and detonated at a time). When the grenade is fired, a small radar pops out of the weapon, showing enemies that are nearby. Formally known as the \"M363 Remote Projectile Detonator\".</li><li><b>Railgun</b> - A weapon that fires a quick-moving high-explosive grenade. Like the Spartan Laser, it requires a charging phase (which is shorter, quieter, and does not have a targeting laser, but noticably glows blue). Formally known as the \"Asymmetric Recoil Carbine-920\".</li><li><a href=\"/m9-fragmentation-grenade/3055-1222/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1222\"><b>Frag Grenade</b></a> - A standard timed <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">fragmentation grenade</a> with a three-second fuse.

It does not require reloading, and cannot be replenished by picking up ammo. Can be used in custom loadouts as the Secondary Weapon choice. Formally known as the \"Type-25 Directed Energy Pistol\".</li><li><a href=\"/t-55-storm-rifle/3055-5703/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5703\"><b>Storm Rifle</b></a> - A fully-automatic energy-blasting weapon (similar to the <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">Plasma Rifle</a> from previous games) useful for close-to-medium ranged combat. Continuously firing causes the weapon to <a href=\"/overheating/3015-839/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-839\">overheat</a>, in which the weapon must enter a cooldown phase. It does not require reloading, and cannot be replenished by picking up ammo. Can be used in custom loadouts as the Primary Weapon choice.

These shards lock on to enemies, impales them (dealing some damage), and detonate harmlessly after some time. However, seven or more impalements at one time causes all of them to detonate powerfully (known as a super-charge), killing that enemy. Formally known as the \"Type-33 Guided Munitions Launcher\".</li><li><a href=\"/particle-beam-rifle/3055-124/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-124\"><b>Beam Rifle</b></a> - A semi-automatic energy-blasting equivalent of a sniper rifle with a scope attachment (supporting both 5x and 10x magnification).

Formally known as the \"Z-250 Directed Energy Engagement Weapon\".</li><li><b>Scattershot</b> - A hard light equivalent of a shotgun, firing multiple bolts (per blast) that can bounce off surfaces and deal great damage at close range. Formally known as the \"Z-180 Close Combat Rifle\".</li><li><b>Binary Rifle</b> - A semi-automatic hard light equivalent of a sniper rifle that sacrifices magazine size for incredible long-ranged power (allowing players in multiplayer to kill other players, anywhere in the body, with one shot). Supports both 5x and 10x magnification. Formally known as the \"Z-750 Special Application Sniper Rifle\".</li><li><b>Incineration Cannon</b> - A highly-dangerous hard light equivalent of a rocket launcher, launching a powerful short-ranged munition that, when exploded, separates into four less-powerful munitions slightly outward. Formally known as the \"Z-390 High-Explosive Munitions Rifle\".</li><li><b>Pulse Grenade</b> - A grenade equivalent that generates an energy area-of-effect sphere that slows vehicles and drains both sheilds and health. Can be used in custom loadouts as the Grenade choice. Formally known as the \"Z-040 Attenuation Field Generator\".</li></ul><h4>Other Weapons</h4><ul><li><b><a href=\"/oddball/3015-1889/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1889\">Balls</a>/ <a href=\"/flags/3055-336/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-336\">Flags</a></b> - Balls (in the Oddball gametype) and Flags (in the Capture the Flag gametype) can be used to pummel people with melee attacks. In addition, carrying a flag in the Capture the Flag gametype while having the Magnum as one of the weapon slots allows players to <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual-wield</a> both the flag and the firearm. Pressing the fire button (while not dual-wielding) drops the object.</li><li><b>Flood Talon</b> - The main weapon of the <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood</a> players in the Flood multiplayer gametype. Functions exactly like the Energy Sword (with infinite ammo).</li></ul><h3>Armor Abilities</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Armor Abilities are re-usable active abilities (introduced in <a href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\">Halo: Reach</a>) that must be re-charged over time after every use. Unlike Halo: Reach, players can now sprint without requiring an armor ability.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In Campaign Mode, they must be picked up manually at certain points in the game. In multiplayer modes, players can customize them for use in custom loadouts.</p><ul><li><b>Promethean Vision</b> - Allows the player to locate enemies by showing a special visor (similar to VISR mode from <a href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST</a>). It allows players to see these enemy signatures through walls at short-to-medium range (shown as red outlines). However, enemy radars show a red wave emitting from a point (showing where the player is) and how far he can see enemy signatures.</li><li><b>Thruster Pack</b> - Allows the player to dash (in similar vein to the Evade ability in Halo: Reach), moving a short distance in the player's current moving direction. It breaks lock-on with certain weapons, but temporarily prevents the player from firing.</li><li><b>Hologram</b> - Allows the player to summon a <a href=\"/decoy/3015-6116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6116\">decoy</a> of themselves for a short period of time, which runs towards a marked waypoint (set on the crosshair). When shot, the hologram flickers around, making it easier to tell.</li><li><b>Jet Pack</b> - Allows the player to manuever in mid-air by thrusting upward (depending on how long the ability button is held).</li><li><b>Hardlight Shield</b> - Allows the player to defend themselves from most weapons by deploying a protective hard light barrier. The shield is vulnerable to melee attacks and explosives and depletes after absorbing a large amount of damage.</li><li><b>Active Camouflage</b> - Allows the player to hide from their surroundings by <a href=\"/camouflage/3015-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-149\">blending into the environment</a> (with varying degrees of effectiveness, depending on the environment and the player's movement). It also toggles a <a href=\"/radar-jammer/3055-1225/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1225\">radar-jamming</a> effect for nearby enemies (making it harder to find the player, but notifies those enemies that a camouflaged enemy is nearby).</li><li><b>Autosentry</b> - Allows the player to deploy a powerful stationary turret that automatically targets enemies. Deploying the autosentry makes the player temporarily vulnerable (and loud).</li><li><b>Regeneration Field</b> - Allows the player to deploy a short-range energy field that heals the health and shields of nearby players (both friendly and enemy). Not encountered in the Campaign.</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/sprinting/3015-603/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-603\">Sprint</a> ability from the previous game has been reworked and added to the main game as a permanent function. Players under fire sprint more slowly (to make escaping away or charging towards more difficult). The infamous <a href=\"/armor-lock/3015-5127/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5127\">Armor Lock</a> ability, which sacrificed mobility for temporary invincibility and a close-ranged EMP blast, was removed from Halo 4 (and slightly replaced by the Hardlight Shield).

There are two distinct modes within the Infinity multiplayer: War Games (competitive multiplayer) and Spartan Ops (cooperative multiplayer). Infinity also includes Forge Mode (where players can create variations of War Games maps for use in custom games) and Theater Mode (where players can watch film clips of War Games matches).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Both modes allow players to customize their <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">SPARTAN-IV</a> soldiers with unlockable armor choices, color schemes, unlockable <a href=\"/emblem/3015-4361/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4361\">emblems</a>, callsigns, and unlockable custom loadouts (including which weapons they spawn with, what type of <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades</a>, which <a href=\"/armor-abilities/3015-5136/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5136\">armor ability</a> they start with, and what type of <a href=\"/perks/3015-366/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-366\">passive abilities</a> they have).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like <a href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\">Halo: Reach</a>, the game includes an <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience system</a> (in which players gain XP points by completing War Games and Spartan Ops matches, winning those matches, performing well on War Games matches, and fulfilling daily, weekly, and monthly challenges). However, they are no longer used as currency. The concept of military ranks (which, in Halo: Reach, is based on the total accumulated currency, or \"credits\") have been replaced by numeric \"Spartan Ranks\" (or SR). Each Spartan Rank grants Spartan Points (which can be used to unlock specific parts on custom loadouts, such as specfic weapons and abilities) and sometimes unlockable gear (such as armor choices, emblems, and an increase in custom loadouts). Prior to using a Specialization (see below), the maximum SR achieved is SR-50. If the player reaches that rank or the maximum rank for their current Specialization, they can no longer accumulate experience until they switch Specializations. (If they reach the maximum rank for all Specializations, at SR-130, they can no longer accumulate experience at all.)</p><h3>Specializations</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">New to Halo 4 is the Specialization system, which allows players to upgrade their Spartan Ranks even further while unlocking new armor permutations, emblems, weapon skins, and passive abilities. There is a total of eight Specializations to choose from, each with ten Specialization Ranks. Players must reach the maximum Specialization Rank in order to switch to another Specialization. Each player's Spartan ID card (in game lobbies) shows their current Specialization (or \"SPARTAN-IV\" for no Specialization).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Each Specialization follows the same Rank pattern for unlocking their assets:</p><ol><li>Foreground Emblems</li><li>Chest Armor</li><li>Shoulder Armor</li><li>Helmet Armor</li><li>Weapon Skin and Background Emblems</li><li>Visor Color</li><li>Chest Armor (Variant Skin)</li><li>Shoulder Armor (Variant Skin)</li><li>Helmet Armor (Variant Skin)</li><li>Passive Ability</li></ol><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Prior to February 4, 2013, new players only started with the Wetwork and Operator specialization choices (unless they have accessed the Specialization Priority Alpha DLC, which was included in the Limited Edition version and was given to all players who have played the game within the first two weeks of launch). Two new specialization choices were unlocked every week between January 21 and February 4, until all eight choices were unlocked.</p><ul><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Wetwork</b> (WK) - Players who finish this Specialization earn the Stealth support upgrade, which dampens footstep noise while sprinting, increases the speed of triggering assassinations, and lowers visibility on enemies that are using Promethean Vision (showing up blue instead of red, and staying completely hidden behind walls and other objects). Players can also earn the Wetwork armor set (and its \"SHARD\" skin set), a blue-on-orange visor, and the \"NOBLE\" skin for the DMR (yellow diagonal stripes).</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Operator</b> (OP) - Players who finish this Specialization earn the Wheelman tactical package, which restricts the EMP effect against the vehicles they drive and increases the shield regeneration rate of the vehicles they drive.

Players can also earn the Stalker armor set (and its \"CRUSH\" skin set), a yellow visor, and the \"DUNES\" skin for the Battle Rifle (orange camo).</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Rogue</b> (RG) - Players who finish this Specialization earn the Stability support upgrade, which reduces recoil from taking damage while zoomed in. Players can also earn the Rogue armor set (and its \"FOCUS\" skin set), a red-on-purple visor, and the \"REIGN\" skin for the Covenant Carbine (orange camo on gray).</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Tracker</b> (TK) - Players who finish this Specialization earn the Requisition tactical package, which grants the ability to \"re-roll\" Personal Ordnance Drops (by pressing Up on the D-Pad, players get three new choices to replace the old ones). Players can also earn the Tracker armor set (and its \"ADROIT\" skin set), a purple visor, and the \"PISTON\" skin for the Boltshot (turquise camo on light gray).</p></li></ul><h3>Loadouts</h3><figure style=\"width: 640px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343710\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343710\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png 640w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">New to Halo 4 is the concept of customized loadouts (making use of the loadout system from <a href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\">Halo: Reach</a>). Players start with one custom loadout slot (with the Assault Rifle, Magnum, and Frag Grenades). As players progress their Spartan Ranks, they gain new custom loadout slots (at SR-06, SR-14, SR-26, and SR-41, for a maximum of five slots) and new options for custom loadouts.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Custom gametypes can make use of optional gametype loadouts (which can be used alongside or in place of custom loadouts), in which all components do not need to be unlocked (by Spartan Rank) or purchased (by Spartan Points). Passive abilities from Specializations cannot be used in gametype loadouts. These loadouts can also use any weapon for the Primary and/or Secondary Weapon slots.</p><ul><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Primary Weapon</b> - The player's primary loadout weapon.

This is the first time in the franchise where competitive multiplayer is part of in-universe lore. Up to 16 players, with their customized <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">SPARTAN-IV</a> soldier, can participate in free-for-all or team matches (with up to 8 teams) under a variation of customizable gametypes. Unlike every game in the Halo franchise (with competitive multiplayer) since <a href=\"/halo-2/3030-7110/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2</a>, players can no longer play as <a href=\"/covenant-elite/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites</a> in any way.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The War Games mode includes ten new maps (one of which is a remake of <a href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\">Halo 3's</a> Valhalla, which is a loose remake of <a href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved's</a> <a href=\"/blood-gulch/3035-322/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-322\">Blood Gulch</a> and <a href=\"/halo-2/3030-7110/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2's</a> <a href=\"/coagulation/3035-1232/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1232\">Coagulation</a>), a variety of downloadable maps, and a variety of new game modes, including Dominion (a team objective-based mode in which teams gain points by maintaining control of special \"bases\"), Extraction (a team objective-based mode in which teams gain points by successfully capturing \"extraction sites\"), and Regicide (a deathmatch-based mode where the leading player, either in general or for each team, is designated the \"king\", who slowly gains special abilities while granting \"bounty points\" to players who kill him/her). Slayer, Oddball, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill each make a return from previous Halo games. Infection mode has been replaced by Flood, which makes more use out of player loadouts and replaces <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">zombie</a> Spartans with the <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood</a>.

In game modes with Personal Ordnance (such as Infinity Slayer), players can earn their own specialized Ordnance Drop (in which they can choose between three choices of weapons, grenades, and power-ups) at their designated location after reaching a certain score threshold. Forge Mode also makes a return, with three new Forge maps and new features (dynamic lighting, player zones that change the player's abilities, the ability to connect pieces together magnetically, the ability to instantly duplicate objects, and the ability to lock objects into place).</p><h3>Maps</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game includes ten shipped maps and three Forge environments.

Various gametypes from the game's predecessors (including Assault, Juggernaut, Territories, Headhunter, Stockpile, and Invasion) have not been implemented. Halo 4 also removes various pre-defined gametype variants (such as Neutral Flag and Rocketball), but maintains the high level of customizability for all gametypes (old and new) as previous games.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Common gametype variants in matchmaking include Rumble (which are built for 8-player free-for-all play), Doubles (which are built for 2-on-2 play with a lower point limit), and Big Team (which are built for large 8-on-8 play with a higher point limit and no friendly fire). Infinity and Pro variants function identically with Infinity Slayer and Slayer Pro (with some exceptions).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One new gametype, Ricochet, was added in a later Title Update as a timed exclusive for the Champions Bundle DLC set. It is the first official gametype (not just a variant) in the Halo series to be released post-launch. Two returning gametypes, Race and Rocket Race, were added in a later Title Update.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3>Slayer</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Originated in Halo: Combat Evolved.</p><figure style=\"width: 460px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469257\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.56521739130435\" data-width=\"460\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469257\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png 460w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png 460w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2469257-gt_slayer.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Standard <a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch</a> in free-for-all or team scenarios.

Players must also protect their own team's flag (by killing flag carriers and making sure their dropped flag is untouched for a certain amount of time, in which it returns back to base).

Each round starts with most of the players as Spartans, whose goal is to survive for the entire round. The remaining players, as Flood, must \"convert\" each Spartan by successfully killing them. Spartans who are \"converted\" (either by getting killed by Flood players or by suicide) are automatically switched to the Flood team. The round ends after either three minutes (in which the survivors get bonus points) or all Spartan players are converted.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While the teams are present in this game, players can only win individually by earning the most amount of points after all three rounds are complete.

Flood players have 200% melee damage, 150% movement speed, and 150% jump height. (However, they have 50% damage resistance and cannot use vehicles). Players who start off as the Flood are \"Alpha Flood\" players, which gives them 300% melee damage, 170% movement speed, and almost double sensor range. Regardless of Flood type, Flood players have enhanced armor abilities.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the variation used for matchmaking, friendly fire is disabled.</p><h4>Matchmaking Variants</h4><ul><li><b>Hivemind</b> - A simpler, slower variation that requires coordination and teamwork on both sides (especially Flood).

Spartan players now start with an Assault Rifle instead of a Shotgun, can pick up ammo and weapons dropped by dead teammates, and can find weapon ordnance scattered around the map (both Initial and Random). Although Spartans can no longer use vehicles and have 90% movement speed, they can now instantly kill with melee attacks. The Last Man Standing now has shields reminiscent of normal game modes, double sensor range, and double damage output. Flood players have significantly weaker damage output (50%), requiring multiple attacks to kill enemy Spartans, and only have 125% jump height (as opposed to 150% in normal Flood).

These new additions to the Forge toolset allow Forgers in Halo 4 to make maps with more creative geometry and aesthetically appealing designs than was possible in Reach:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Dynamic Lighting:</b> In Reach, the Forge pieces that players could use to build their maps cast no shadows on the canvas map (typically Forge World) or on other pieces, and did not accept real-time shadows from the global light source of the map. This fact, along with the uniform gray color scheme of the Forge pieces, led to most Forge maps looking very similarly bland, which was a major source of complaint amongst the community. In order to help address this problem of poor aesthetics, the Halo 4 Forge mode features a new \"dynamic lighting\" system which allows the Forge pieces to accept real-time shadows from the global light source, and to cast shadows of their own, allowing for more variability in map design.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Player-Trait Zones:</b> In Halo 4's Forge, map makers have the ability to designate special areas of the map and give players within those areas unique traits or abilities with the addition of \"Player-Trait Zones\" to the Forge sandbox. Player-Trait Zones can be manipulated in the Forge space the same way that soft-kill zones or objectives zones (Hill markers, etc.) were in Reach. Forgers can use Player-Trait Zones to create a portion of the map where all players are invisible, for example, or create a zone with lowered gravity and increased jump height.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Object-Magnetism:</b> While building a map in Reach, objects could be moved precisely by using a zoomed-in camera or even by changing their exact coordinates, but it was still cumbersome for a player to perfectly align separate pieces. The Halo 4 Forge mode has a \"magnet\" feature that streamlines the process of aligning Forge pieces. Players can magnetize specific objects, which allows them to snap to other objects automatically for easier map building.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Highlighting</b>: Objects are illuminated in green when the player's reticle is hovering over them. This feature was added to make it less frustrating for Forgers to select the correct piece when modifying a map, because in Reach a player could not easily tell which piece they were selecting when there were many objects in close-proximity.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Duplication</b>: Forge Objects can be easily duplicated simply by highlighting the object and then selecting the \"duplicate\" option from the Forge menu.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Locking:</b> Objects can be locked in place, preventing them from being moved until the player chooses to unlock them. This feature was added to help players preserve their work-in-progress designs and keep pieces from being accidentally moved.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><h3>Halo 4 Original Soundtrack (<a href=\"/neil-davidge/3040-101659/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-101659\">Neil Davidge</a>)</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>No.</th><th>Track Title</th><th>Length</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td><b>Awakening</b></td><td>5:41</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td><b>Belly of the Beast</b></td><td>2:38</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td><b>Requiem</b></td><td>2:16</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td><b>Legacy</b></td><td>2:29</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td><b>Faithless</b></td><td>5:02</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td><b>Haven</b></td><td>5:45</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td><b>Nemesis</b></td><td>3:31</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td><b>Ascendancy</b></td><td>4:20</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td><b>Solace</b></td><td>4:45</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td><b>To Galaxy</b></td><td>4:57</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td><b>Immaterial</b></td><td>7:33</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td><b>117</b> (composed by Kazuma Jinnouchi)</td><td>7:28</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td><b>Arrival</b></td><td>5:37</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td><b>Revival</b></td><td>7:19</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td><b>Green and Blue</b></td><td>8:01</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Halo 4 Original Soundtrack - Special Digital Edition</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>No.</th><th>Track Title</th><th>Length</th></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>Awakening (Gui Boratto remix)</td><td>1:34</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>To Galaxy (Sander Van Doorn &amp; Julian Jordan Remix)</td><td>2:38</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>Ascendancy (Caspa Remix)</td><td>1:02</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td>Revival (DJ Skee &amp; THX Remix)</td><td>1:01</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td>Requiem (Bobby Tank Remix)</td><td>1:00</td></tr><tr><td>21.</td><td>The Beauty Of Cortana (Apocalyptica vs. Neil Davidge)</td><td>1:57</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Halo 4 Original Soundtrack Remixes</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>No.</th><th>Track Title</th><th>Length</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Awakening (Gui Boratto Remix)</td><td>7:24</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Green And Blue (Koan Sound Remix)</td><td>4:02</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Requiem (Bobby Tank Remix)</td><td>5:36</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Ascendancy (Caspa Remix)</td><td>3:55</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>To Galaxy (Sander Van Doorn &amp; Julian Jordan Remix)</td><td>6:48</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Haven (Hundred Waters Remix)</td><td>4:22</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Revival (DJ Skee &amp; THX Remix)</td><td>3:37</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Ascendancy (Matt Lange Remix)</td><td>5:04</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Nemesis (Alvin Risk Remix)</td><td>4:39</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Solace (Maor Levi Remix)</td><td>7:17</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>Arrival (Norin &amp; Rad Remix)</td><td>4:00</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>Green And Blue (Andrew Bayer Remix)</td><td>3:24</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>Foreshadow (James Iha Remix)</td><td>2:51</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>The Beauty of Cortana (Apocalyptica vs. Neil Davidge Remix)</td><td>5:08</td></tr></tbody></table>",

Each round starts with most of the players as Survivors, whose goal is to survive for the entire round. The remaining players, as Infected, must \"convert\" each Survivor to their team by successfully killing them. While teams are present in this mode, players can only win individually by earning the most amount of points after all rounds are complete. Rounds end when either the Survivor team is empty or after the game timer depletes</p><p>By default, Infected players have Energy Swords (with infinite ammo) and improved jumping. However, they have no shields, cannot use vehicles, and cannot Sprint, Charge, or Ground Pound. The players who start the round as Infected (the \"Infected Alpha\") gain invisibility. Survivors start with the Shotgun and Assault Rifle. The last Survivor remaining gains improved shields (+200%), improved reloading speed (+40%), and infinite ammo, but their location is visible to everybody else. Survivors get 5 points per kill, 25 points for being the last one standing, and 25 points for surviving the round. Infected get 10 points per kill and 25 points for killing the last Survivor standing. Survivors lose 10 points per suicide/betrayal.</p><h3>Oddball</h3><p>Added on November 2, 2017.

These items are earned throughout the player's career through Requisition Packs, are <a href=\"/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4702\">color-coded in rarity</a>, and sometimes provide unique versions of normal items.</p><p>Players can only use single-use Requisitions in-game either before they spawn or through special terminals located throughout each base (called REQ Stations). Each single-use Requisition has a REQ Level assigned to them, and players can only use them if they have enough REQ Energy (which regenerates over time and grows larger throughout the match) meets that requirement.</p><p>While unique weapon variants can only be found normally in Requisitions, these weapons can appear in Forged and Fiesta variants of Arena mode and some can be found as hidden weapons in the campaign.</p><h3>Weapons (Loadout)</h3><p>Basic</p><ul><li><strong>Assault Rifle</strong> (C-1) - Projection Sight for short-to-medium range.
